    "Title": "CVE-2020-3812 on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "qmail-verify as used in netqmail 1.06 is prone to an information disclosure vulnerability. A local attacker can test for the existence of files and directories anywhere in the filesystem because qmail-verify runs as root and tests for the existence of files in the attacker's home directory, without dropping its privileges first. It was discovered that netqmail did not properly handle certain input when validating email addresses. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause netqmail to disclose sensitive information.",
