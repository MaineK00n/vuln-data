    "Title": "CVE-2018-11407 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Ldap component in Symfony 2.8.x before 2.8.37, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.7, and 4.0.x before 4.0.7. It allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by logging in with a \"null\" password and valid username, which triggers an unauthenticated bind.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-2403. It was discovered that Symfony allowed unauthorized access on a misconfigured LDAP server. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.",
