    "Description": "GPAC version 0.7.1 and earlier has a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the gf_sm_load_init function in scene_manager.c in libgpac_static.a. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
