    "Description": "A flaw was found in Mercurial before 4.9. It was possible to use symlinks and subrepositories to defeat Mercurial's path-checking logic and write files outside a repository. It was discovered that Mercurial mishandled symlinks in subrepositories. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write arbitrary files to the target's filesystem.",
