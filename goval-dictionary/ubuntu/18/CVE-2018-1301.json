    "Title": "CVE-2018-1301 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.",
