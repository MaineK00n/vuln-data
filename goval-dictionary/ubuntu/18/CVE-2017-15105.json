    "Title": "CVE-2017-15105 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way unbound before 1.6.8 validated wildcard-synthesized NSEC records. An improperly validated wildcard NSEC record could be used to prove the non-existence (NXDOMAIN answer) of an existing wildcard record, or trick unbound into accepting a NODATA proof. Ralph Dolmans and Karst Koymans discovered that Unbound did not properly handle certain NSEC records. An attacker could use this to to prove the non-existence (NXDOMAIN answer) of an existing wildcard record, or trick Unbound into accepting a NODATA proof.",
