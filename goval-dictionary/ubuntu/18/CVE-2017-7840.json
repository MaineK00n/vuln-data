    "Title": "CVE-2017-7840 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 57.",
