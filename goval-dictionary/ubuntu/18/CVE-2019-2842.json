    "Title": "CVE-2019-2842 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JCE). The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 8u212. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.7 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). Nati Nimni discovered that the Java Cryptography Extension component in OpenJDK did not properly perform array bounds checking in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
