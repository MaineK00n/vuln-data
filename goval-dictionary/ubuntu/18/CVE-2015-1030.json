    "Title": "CVE-2015-1030 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Memory leak in the rfc2553_connect_to function in jbsocket.c in Privoxy before 3.0.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of requests that are rejected because the socket limit is reached. It was discovered that privoxy doesn't handle a large number of requests properly. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
