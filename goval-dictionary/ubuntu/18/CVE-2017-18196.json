    "Title": "CVE-2017-18196 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "Leptonica 1.74.4 constructs unintended pathnames (containing duplicated path components) when operating on files in /tmp subdirectories, which might allow local users to bypass intended file restrictions by leveraging access to a directory located deeper within the /tmp directory tree, as demonstrated by /tmp/ANY/PATH/ANY/PATH/input.tif. It was discovered that Leptonica incorrectly handled path names. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.",
