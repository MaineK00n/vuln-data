    "Title": "CVE-2016-9132 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "In Botan 1.8.0 through 1.11.33, when decoding BER data an integer overflow could occur, which would cause an incorrect length field to be computed. Some API callers may use the returned (incorrect and attacker controlled) length field in a way which later causes memory corruption or other failure. It was discovered that Botan did not properly decode BER data while parsing untrusted inputs such as X.509 certificates. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory corruption or other failure, resulting in an integer overflow attack.",
