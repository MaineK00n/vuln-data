    "Title": "CVE-2018-2678 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JNDI). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151; JRockit: R28.3.16. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). It was discovered that the JNDI component of OpenJDK did not properly restrict the amount of memory allocated when deserializing objects in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption).",
