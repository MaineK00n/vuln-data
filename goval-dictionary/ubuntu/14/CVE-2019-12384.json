    "Title": "CVE-2019-12384 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.1 might allow attackers to have a variety of impacts by leveraging failure to block the logback-core class from polymorphic deserialization. Depending on the classpath content, remote code execution may be possible. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.",
