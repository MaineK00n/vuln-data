    "Title": "CVE-2020-15437 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel before version 5.8 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:serial8250_isa_init_ports() that allows local users to cause a denial of service by using the p-\u003eserial_in pointer which uninitialized. It was discovered that the serial port driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a pointer in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
