    "Title": "CVE-2019-14814 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "There is heap-based buffer overflow in Linux kernel, all versions up to, excluding 5.3, in the marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel, that allows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. Wen Huang discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking, leading to a heap overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
