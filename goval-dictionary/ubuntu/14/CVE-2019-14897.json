    "Title": "CVE-2019-14897 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel, version kernel-2.6.32, in Marvell WiFi chip driver. An attacker is able to cause a denial of service (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when a STA works in IBSS mode (allows connecting stations together without the use of an AP) and connects to another STA. It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell Libertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
