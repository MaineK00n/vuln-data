    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux Kernel where the function sunkbd_reinit having been scheduled by sunkbd_interrupt before sunkbd being freed. Though the dangling pointer is set to NULL in sunkbd_disconnect, there is still an alias in sunkbd_reinit causing Use After Free. Bodong Zhao discovered a use-after-free in the Sun keyboard driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
