    "Title": "CVE-2016-9950 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. There is a path traversal issue in the Apport crash file \"Package\" and \"SourcePackage\" fields. These fields are used to build a path to the package specific hook files in the /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/ directory. An attacker can exploit this path traversal to execute arbitrary Python files from the local system. Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that Apport did not properly sanitize the Package and SourcePackage fields in crash files before processing package specific hooks. An attacker could use this to convince a user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user.",
