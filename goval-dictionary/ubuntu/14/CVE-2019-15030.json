    "Title": "CVE-2019-15030 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.2.14 on the powerpc platform, a local user can read vector registers of other users' processes via a Facility Unavailable exception. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin) and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check. It was discovered that the Linux kernel on PowerPC architectures did not properly handle Facility Unavailable exceptions in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
