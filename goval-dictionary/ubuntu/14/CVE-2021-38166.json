    "Title": "CVE-2021-38166 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In kernel/bpf/hashtab.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.8, there is an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write when many elements are placed in a single bucket. NOTE: exploitation might be impractical without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability. It was discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow in its hash table implementation. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
