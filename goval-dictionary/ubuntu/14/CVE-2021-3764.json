    "Title": "CVE-2021-3764 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c in the Linux kernel allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). It happens if function ccp_init_data(\u0026src) returns error code (that is being called from the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd). It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
