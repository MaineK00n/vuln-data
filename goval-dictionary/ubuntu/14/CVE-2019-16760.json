    "Title": "CVE-2019-16760 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency if your package.toml file uses the `package` configuration key. Usage of the `package` key to rename dependencies in `Cargo.toml` is ignored in Rust 1.25.0 and prior. When Rust 1.25.0 and prior is used Cargo may download the wrong dependency, which could be squatted on crates.io to be a malicious package. This not only affects manifests that you write locally yourself, but also manifests published to crates.io. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0 is affected by this advisory because Cargo will ignore the `package` key in manifests. Rust 1.26.0 through Rust 1.30.0 are not affected and typically will emit an error because the `package` key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0 and after are not affected because Cargo understands the `package` key. Users of the affected versions are strongly encouraged to update their compiler to the latest available one. Preventing this issue from happening requires updating your compiler to be either Rust 1.26.0 or newer. There will be no point release for Rust versions prior to 1.26.0. Users of Rust 1.19.0 to Rust 1.25.0 can instead apply linked patches to mitigate the issue. ebarretto\u003e Copying the advisory note on affected versions. ebarretto\u003e Affected Versions ebarretto\u003e Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0 is affected by this advisory because ebarretto\u003e Cargo will ignore the package key in manifests. Rust 1.26.0 through ebarretto\u003e Rust 1.30.0 are not affected and typically will emit an error ebarretto\u003e because the package key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0 and after are not ebarretto\u003e affected because Cargo understands the package key. ebarretto\u003e In terms of Cargo versions, this affects Cargo up through Cargo ebarretto\u003e 0.26.0. All future versions of Cargo are unaffected.",
