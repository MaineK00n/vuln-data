    "Title": "CVE-2020-14386 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity. Or Cohen discovered that the AF_PACKET implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
