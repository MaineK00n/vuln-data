    "Title": "CVE-2017-1002201 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In haml versions prior to version 5.0.0.beta.2, when using user input to perform tasks on the server, characters like \u003c \u003e \" ' must be escaped properly. In this case, the ' character was missed. An attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code. It was discovered that Haml did not properly escape the ' character. If Haml were made to process crafted data, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
