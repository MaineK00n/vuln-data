    "Title": "CVE-2020-14385 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. A failure of the file system metadata validator in XFS can cause an inode with a valid, user-creatable extended attribute to be flagged as corrupt. This can lead to the filesystem being shutdown, or otherwise rendered inaccessible until it is remounted, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. David Alan Gilbert discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform metadata validation in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
