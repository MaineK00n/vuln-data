    "Title": "CVE-2020-27152 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in ioapic_lazy_update_eoi in arch/x86/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel before 5.9.2. It has an infinite loop related to improper interaction between a resampler and edge triggering, aka CID-77377064c3a9. It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor in the Linux kernel did not properly handle interrupts in certain situations. A local attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash).",
