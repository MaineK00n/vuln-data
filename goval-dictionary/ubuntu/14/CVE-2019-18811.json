    "Title": "CVE-2019-18811 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the sof_set_get_large_ctrl_data() function in sound/soc/sof/ipc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering sof_get_ctrl_copy_params() failures, aka CID-45c1380358b1. It was discovered that the Sound Open Firmware (SOF) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
