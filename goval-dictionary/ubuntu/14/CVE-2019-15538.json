    "Title": "CVE-2019-15538 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9. XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of being out of disk quota. xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing to unlock the ILOCK after the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call fails. This is primarily a local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS. Benjamin Moody discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly handle an error condition when out of disk quota. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
