    "Title": "CVE-2020-10732 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of Userspace core dumps. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to crash a trivial program and exfiltrate private kernel data. It was discovered that the elf handling code in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory before using it in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
