    "Title": "CVE-2014-2734 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** The openssl extension in Ruby 2.x does not properly maintain the state of process memory after a file is reopened, which allows remote attackers to spoof signatures within the context of a Ruby script that attempts signature verification after performing a certain sequence of filesystem operations.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Ruby OpenSSL team and third parties, who state that the original demonstration PoC contains errors and redundant or unnecessarily-complex code that does not appear to be related to a demonstration of the issue. As of 20140502, CVE is not aware of any public comment by the original researcher.",
