    "Title": "CVE-2018-20194 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "There is a stack-based buffer underflow in the third instance of the calculate_gain function in libfaad/sbr_hfadj.c in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. A crafted input will lead to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact because limiting the additional noise energy level is mishandled for the G_max \u003c= G case. It was discovered that Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 incorrectly validated user input when processing crafted AAC files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
