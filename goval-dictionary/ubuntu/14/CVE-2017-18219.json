    "Description": "An issue was discovered in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26. An allocation failure vulnerability was found in the function ReadOnePNGImage in coders/png.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file that triggers an attempt at a large png_pixels array allocation.
