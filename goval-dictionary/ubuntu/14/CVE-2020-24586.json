    "Title": "CVE-2020-24586 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation did not properly clear received fragments from memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or expose sensitive information.",
