    "Title": "CVE-2020-14351 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free memory flaw was found in the perf subsystem allowing a local attacker with permission to monitor perf events to corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker with access to the perf subsystem could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
