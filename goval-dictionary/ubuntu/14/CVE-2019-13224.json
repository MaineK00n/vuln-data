    "Title": "CVE-2019-13224 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free in onig_new_deluxe() in regext.c in Oniguruma 6.9.2 allows attackers to potentially cause information disclosure, denial of service, or possibly code execution by providing a crafted regular expression. The attacker provides a pair of a regex pattern and a string, with a multi-byte encoding that gets handled by onig_new_deluxe(). Oniguruma issues often affect Ruby, as well as common optional libraries for PHP and Rust. It was discovered that Oniguruma incorrectly handled certain regular expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.",
