    "Title": "CVE-2020-27170 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-f232326f6966. This affects pointer types that do not define a ptr_limit. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly apply speculative execution limits on some pointer types. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
