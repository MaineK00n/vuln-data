    "Title": "CVE-2014-0225 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "When processing user provided XML documents, the Spring Framework 4.0.0 to 4.0.4, 3.0.0 to 3.2.8, and possibly earlier unsupported versions did not disable by default the resolution of URI references in a DTD declaration. This enabled an XXE attack. It was discovered that the Spring Framework incorrectly handled XML documents. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, disclosure of information or other unspecified impact.",
