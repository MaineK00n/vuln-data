    "Title": "CVE-2019-12819 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0. The function __mdiobus_register() in drivers/net/phy/mdio_bus.c calls put_device(), which will trigger a fixed_mdio_bus_init use-after-free. This will cause a denial of service. It was discovered that the MDIO bus devices subsystem in the Linux kernel improperly dropped a device reference in an error condition, leading to a use-after-free. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
