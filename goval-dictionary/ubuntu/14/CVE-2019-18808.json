    "Title": "CVE-2019-18808 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the ccp_run_sha_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-128c66429247. It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
