    "Title": "CVE-2019-14283 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.2.3, set_geometry in drivers/block/floppy.c does not validate the sect and head fields, as demonstrated by an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read. It can be triggered by an unprivileged local user when a floppy disk has been inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates the floppy device by default. It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
