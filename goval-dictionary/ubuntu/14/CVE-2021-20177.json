    "Title": "CVE-2021-20177 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of string matching within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) when inserting iptables rules could insert a rule which can panic the system. Kernel before kernel 5.5-rc1 is affected. It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle filter rules in some situations. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a denial of service.",
