    "Title": "CVE-2019-17351 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/xen/balloon.c in the Linux kernel before 5.2.3, as used in Xen through 4.12.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a denial of service because of unrestricted resource consumption during the mapping of guest memory, aka CID-6ef36ab967c7. Julien Grall discovered that the Xen balloon memory driver in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the amount of memory set aside for page mappings in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
