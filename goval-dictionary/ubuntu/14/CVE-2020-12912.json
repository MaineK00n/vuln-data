    "Title": "CVE-2020-12912 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A potential vulnerability in the AMD extension to Linux \"hwmon\" service may allow an attacker to use the Linux-based Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface to show various side channel attacks. In line with industry partners, AMD has updated the RAPL interface to require privileged access. It was discovered that the AMD Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to power data. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
