    "Title": "CVE-2020-7053 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 4.14 longterm through 4.14.165 and 4.19 longterm through 4.19.96 (and 5.x before 5.2), there is a use-after-free (write) in the i915_ppgtt_close function in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_gtt.c, aka CID-7dc40713618c. This is related to i915_gem_context_destroy_ioctl in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_context.c. It was discovered that a race condition can lead to a use-after-free while destroying GEM contexts in the i915 driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
