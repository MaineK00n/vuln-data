    "Title": "CVE-2020-26979 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84.",
