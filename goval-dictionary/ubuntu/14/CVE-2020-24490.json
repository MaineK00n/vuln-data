    "Title": "CVE-2020-24490 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Improper buffer restrictions in BlueZ may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via adjacent access. This affects all Linux kernel versions that support BlueZ. Andy Nguyen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI event packet parser in the Linux kernel did not properly handle event advertisements of certain sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A physically proximate remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
