    "Title": "CVE-2020-12826 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A signal access-control issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.5, aka CID-7395ea4e65c2. Because exec_id in include/linux/sched.h is only 32 bits, an integer overflow can interfere with a do_notify_parent protection mechanism. A child process can send an arbitrary signal to a parent process in a different security domain. Exploitation limitations include the amount of elapsed time before an integer overflow occurs, and the lack of scenarios where signals to a parent process present a substantial operational threat. It was discovered that the exit signaling implementation in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (arbitrary application crash).",
