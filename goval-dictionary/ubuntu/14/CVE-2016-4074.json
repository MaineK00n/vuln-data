    "Title": "CVE-2016-4074 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The jv_dump_term function in jq 1.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and application crash) via a crafted JSON file. This issue has been fixed in jg 1.6_rc1-r0. It was discovered that jq did not perform sufficient bounds checking, resulting in unbounded resource consumption. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.",
