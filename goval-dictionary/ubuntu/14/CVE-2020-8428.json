    "Title": "CVE-2020-8428 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "fs/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5 has a may_create_in_sticky use-after-free, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-d0cb50185ae9. One attack vector may be an open system call for a UNIX domain socket, if the socket is being moved to a new parent directory and its old parent directory is being removed. Al Viro discovered that the vfs layer in the Linux kernel contained a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
