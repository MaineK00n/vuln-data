    "Title": "CVE-2020-27830 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel where in the spk_ttyio_receive_buf2() function, it would dereference spk_ttyio_synth without checking whether it is NULL or not, and may lead to a NULL-ptr deref crash. Shisong Qin and Bodong Zhao discovered that Speakup screen reader driver in the Linux kernel did not correctly handle setting line discipline in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
