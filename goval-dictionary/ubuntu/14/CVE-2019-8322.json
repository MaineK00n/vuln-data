    "Title": "CVE-2019-8322 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. The gem owner command outputs the contents of the API response directly to stdout. Therefore, if the response is crafted, escape sequence injection may occur. It was discovered that the `gem owner`a command failed to sanitize the contents of the API response. An attacker could use this vulnerability inject escape sequences into a victim's terminal.",
