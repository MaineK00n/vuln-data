    "Title": "CVE-2019-2181 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In binder_transaction of binder.c in the Android kernel, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an integer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Binder implementation of the Linux kernel, leading to a buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to escalate privileges.",
