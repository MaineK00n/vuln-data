    "Title": "CVE-2021-3348 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "nbd_add_socket in drivers/block/nbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.12 has an ndb_queue_rq use-after-free that could be triggered by local attackers (with access to the nbd device) via an I/O request at a certain point during device setup, aka CID-b98e762e3d71. It was discovered that the network block device (nbd) driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability during device setup. A local attacker with access to the nbd device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
