    "Title": "CVE-2021-3492 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "Shiftfs, an out-of-tree stacking file system included in Ubuntu Linux kernels, did not properly handle faults occurring during copy_from_user() correctly. These could lead to either a double-free situation or memory not being freed at all. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion) or gain privileges via executing arbitrary code. AKA ZDI-CAN-13562. Vincent Dehors discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly handle faults in copy_from_user() when passing through ioctls to an underlying file system. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) or execute arbitrary code.",
