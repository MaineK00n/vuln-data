    "Title": "CVE-2020-35508 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw possibility of race condition and incorrect initialization of the process id was found in the Linux kernel child/parent process identification handling while filtering signal handlers. A local attacker is able to abuse this flaw to bypass checks to send any signal to a privileged process. It was discovered that a race condition existed that caused the Linux kernel to not properly restrict exit signal delivery. A local attacker could possibly use this to send signals to arbitrary processes.",
