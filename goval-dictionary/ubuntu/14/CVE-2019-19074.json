    "Title": "CVE-2019-19074 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the ath9k_wmi_cmd() function in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/wmi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-728c1e2a05e4. It was discovered that the Atheros HTC based wireless driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
