    "Title": "CVE-2013-1430 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in xrdp before 0.9.1. When successfully logging in using RDP into an xrdp session, the file ~/.vnc/sesman_${username}_passwd is created. Its content is the equivalent of the user's cleartext password, DES encrypted with a known key. It was discovered that xrdp used a known key to store session passwords in text files. An attacker could potentially decrypt the file to obtain a user password.",
