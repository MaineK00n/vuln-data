    "Title": "CVE-2020-24512 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Observable timing discrepancy in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Travis Downs discovered that some Intel processors did not properly flush cache-lines for trivial-data values. This may allow an unauthorized user to infer the presence of these trivial-data-cache-lines via timing sidechannel attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
