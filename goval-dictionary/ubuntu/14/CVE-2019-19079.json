    "Title": "CVE-2019-19079 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the qrtr_tun_write_iter() function in net/qrtr/tun.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-a21b7f0cff19. It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router TUN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
