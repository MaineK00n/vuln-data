    "Title": "CVE-2020-12768 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6. svm_cpu_uninit in arch/x86/kvm/svm.c has a memory leak, aka CID-d80b64ff297e. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it's a one-time leak at the boot, the size is negligible, and it can't be triggered at will. It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory on initialization for some processors. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
