    "Title": "CVE-2017-12862 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp, the length of buffer AutoBuffer _src is small than expected, which will cause copy buffer overflow later. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or denial of service. This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier. It was discovered that OpenCV incorrectly handled certain image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.",
