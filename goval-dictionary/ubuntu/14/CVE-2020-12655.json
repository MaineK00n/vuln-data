    "Title": "CVE-2020-12655 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10. Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka CID-d0c7feaf8767. It was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta data in some circumstances. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service.",
