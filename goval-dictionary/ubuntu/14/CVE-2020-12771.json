    "Title": "CVE-2020-12771 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.11. btree_gc_coalesce in drivers/md/bcache/btree.c has a deadlock if a coalescing operation fails. It was discovered that the bcache subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly release a lock in some error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
