    "Title": "CVE-2019-19532 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.3.9, there are multiple out-of-bounds write bugs that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the Linux kernel HID drivers, aka CID-d9d4b1e46d95. This affects drivers/hid/hid-axff.c, drivers/hid/hid-dr.c, drivers/hid/hid-emsff.c, drivers/hid/hid-gaff.c, drivers/hid/hid-holtekff.c, drivers/hid/hid-lg2ff.c, drivers/hid/hid-lg3ff.c, drivers/hid/hid-lg4ff.c, drivers/hid/hid-lgff.c, drivers/hid/hid-logitech-hidpp.c, drivers/hid/hid-microsoft.c, drivers/hid/hid-sony.c, drivers/hid/hid-tmff.c, and drivers/hid/hid-zpff.c. It was discovered that multiple USB HID device drivers in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata on attachment, leading to out-of- bounds writes. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
