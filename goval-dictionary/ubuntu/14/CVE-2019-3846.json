    "Title": "CVE-2019-3846 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw that allowed an attacker to corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges was found in the mwifiex kernel module while connecting to a malicious wireless network. It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
