    "Title": "CVE-2019-19043 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the i40e_setup_macvlans() function in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_main.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering i40e_setup_channel() failures, aka CID-27d461333459. It was discovered that the Intel(R) XL710 Ethernet Controller device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
