    "Title": "CVE-2020-15852 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.5 through 5.7.9, as used in Xen through 4.13.x for x86 PV guests. An attacker may be granted the I/O port permissions of an unrelated task. This occurs because tss_invalidate_io_bitmap mishandling causes a loss of synchronization between the I/O bitmaps of TSS and Xen, aka CID-cadfad870154. Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle I/O port permissions for paravirtualized (PV) guests on x86 platforms in some situations. An attacker in a paravirtualized guest could possibly use this to gain access to restricted I/O devices.",
