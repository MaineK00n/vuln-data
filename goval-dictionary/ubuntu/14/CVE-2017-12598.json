    "Title": "CVE-2017-12598 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has an out-of-bounds read error in the cv::RBaseStream::readBlock function in modules/imgcodecs/src/bitstrm.cpp when reading an image file by using cv::imread, as demonstrated by the 8-opencv-invalid-read-fread test case. It was discovered that OpenCV incorrectly handled certain image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.",
