    "Title": "CVE-2019-5108 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel prior to mainline 5.3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering AP to send IAPP location updates for stations before the required authentication process has completed. This could lead to different denial-of-service scenarios, either by causing CAM table attacks, or by leading to traffic flapping if faking already existing clients in other nearby APs of the same wireless infrastructure. An attacker can forge Authentication and Association Request packets to trigger this vulnerability. Mitchell Frank discovered that the Wi-Fi implementation in the Linux kernel when used as an access point would send IAPP location updates for stations before client authentication had completed. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
