    "Title": "CVE-2019-11366 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in atftpd in atftp 0.7.1. It does not lock the thread_list_mutex mutex before assigning the current thread data structure. As a result, the daemon is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to a NULL pointer dereference. If thread_data is NULL when assigned to current, and modified by another thread before a certain tftpd_list.c check, there is a crash when dereferencing current-\u003enext. It was discovered that atftp's FTP server did not make proper use of mutexes when locking certain data structures. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference.",
