    "Title": "CVE-2020-2732 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest. Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel could improperly let a nested (level 2) guest access the resources of a parent (level 1) guest in certain situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
