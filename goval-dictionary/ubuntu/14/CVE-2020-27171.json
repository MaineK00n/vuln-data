    "Title": "CVE-2020-27171 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly compute a speculative execution limit on pointer arithmetic in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
