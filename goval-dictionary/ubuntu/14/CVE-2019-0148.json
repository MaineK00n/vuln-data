    "Description": "Resource leak in i40e driver for Intel(R) Ethernet 700 Series Controllers versions before 7.0 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable a denial of service via local access. Ryan Hall discovered that the Intel 700 Series Ethernet Controllers driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
