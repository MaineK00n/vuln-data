    "Title": "CVE-2019-19816 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image and performing some operations can cause slab-out-of-bounds write access in __btrfs_map_block in fs/btrfs/volumes.c, because a value of 1 for the number of data stripes is mishandled. It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate file system metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
