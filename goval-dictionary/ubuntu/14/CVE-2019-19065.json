    "Title": "CVE-2019-19065 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the sdma_init() function in drivers/infiniband/hw/hfi1/sdma.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering rhashtable_init() failures, aka CID-34b3be18a04e. NOTE: This has been disputed as not a vulnerability because \"rhashtable_init() can only fail if it is passed invalid values in the second parameter's struct, but when invoked from sdma_init() that is a pointer to a static const struct, so an attacker could only trigger failure if they could corrupt kernel memory (in which case a small memory leak is not a significant problem).\" It was discovered that the Intel OPA Gen1 Infiniband Driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
