    "Title": "CVE-2019-15291 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9. There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the flexcop_usb_probe function in the drivers/media/usb/b2c2/flexcop-usb.c driver. It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
