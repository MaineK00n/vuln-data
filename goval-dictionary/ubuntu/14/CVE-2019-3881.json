    "Title": "CVE-2019-3881 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Bundler prior to 2.1.0 uses a predictable path in /tmp/, created with insecure permissions as a storage location for gems, if locations under the user's home directory are not available. If Bundler is used in a scenario where the user does not have a writable home directory, an attacker could place malicious code in this directory that would be later loaded and executed. It was discovered that Bundler incorrectly created directories with insecure permissions in /tmp. An attacker could write malicious libraries to this location for later execution.",
