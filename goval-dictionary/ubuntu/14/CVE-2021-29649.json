    "Title": "CVE-2021-29649 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The user mode driver (UMD) has a copy_process() memory leak, related to a lack of cleanup steps in kernel/usermode_driver.c and kernel/bpf/preload/bpf_preload_kern.c, aka CID-f60a85cad677. It was discovered that the BPF user mode driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
