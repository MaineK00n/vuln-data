    "Title": "CVE-2019-19073 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "Memory leaks in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering wait_for_completion_timeout() failures. This affects the htc_config_pipe_credits() function, the htc_setup_complete() function, and the htc_connect_service() function, aka CID-853acf7caf10. It was discovered that the Atheros HTC based wireless driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
