    "Title": "CVE-2020-11565 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.2. mpol_parse_str in mm/mempolicy.c has a stack-based out-of-bounds write because an empty nodelist is mishandled during mount option parsing, aka CID-aa9f7d5172fa. NOTE: Someone in the security community disagrees that this is a vulnerability because the issue “is a bug in parsing mount options which can only be specified by a privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not already held.”. It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
