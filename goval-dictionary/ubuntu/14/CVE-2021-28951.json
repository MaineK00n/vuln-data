    "Title": "CVE-2021-28951 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL thread is waiting for a signal to start, aka CID-3ebba796fa25. It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a deadlock condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
