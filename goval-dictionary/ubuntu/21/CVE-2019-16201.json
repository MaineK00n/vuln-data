    "Description": "WEBrick::HTTPAuth::DigestAuth in Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 has a regular expression Denial of Service cause by looping/backtracking. A victim must expose a WEBrick server that uses DigestAuth to the Internet or a untrusted network. It was discovered that WEBrick as provided by JRuby was vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to catastrophic backtracking in certain regular expressions.  An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause JRuby to consume system resources.",
