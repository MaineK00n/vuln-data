    "Title": "CVE-2017-11565 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "debian/tor.init in the Debian tor_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was designed to execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the apparmor package is installed, but implements this incorrectly (with a wrong assumption that the specific pathname would remain the same forever), which allows attackers to bypass intended AppArmor restrictions by leveraging the silent loss of this protection mechanism. NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as default Debian stretch installations, on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead of this tor.init script). It was discovered that Tor incorrectly implemented AppArmor restrictions. An attacker could possibly bypass those restrictions and cause an unspecified impact.",
