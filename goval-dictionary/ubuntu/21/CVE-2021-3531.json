    "Title": "CVE-2021-3531 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RGW in versions before 14.2.21. When processing a GET Request for a swift URL that ends with two slashes it can cause the rgw to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The greatest threat to the system is of availability. It was discovered that Ceph's RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) did not properly handle GET requests for swift URLs in some situations, leading to an application crash. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
