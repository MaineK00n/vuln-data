    "Title": "CVE-2015-8397 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "The JPEGLSCodec::DecodeExtent function in MediaStorageAndFileFormat/gdcmJPEGLSCodec.cxx in Grassroots DICOM (aka GDCM) before 2.6.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (application crash) via an embedded JPEG-LS image with dimensions larger than the selected region in a (1) two-dimensional or (2) three-dimensional DICOM image file, which triggers an out-of-bounds read. It was discovered that GDCM incorrectly handled certain DICOM image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information from process memory.",
