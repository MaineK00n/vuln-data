    "Title": "CVE-2019-11747 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - negligible.",
    "Description": "The \"Forget about this site\" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http: URL rather than secure https: they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 69 and Firefox ESR \u003c 68.1.",
