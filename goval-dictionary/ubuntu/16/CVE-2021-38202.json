    "Description": "fs/nfsd/trace.h in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read in strlen) by sending NFS traffic when the trace event framework is being used for nfsd. It was discovered that the NFS server implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read when the trace even framework is being used for nfsd. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
