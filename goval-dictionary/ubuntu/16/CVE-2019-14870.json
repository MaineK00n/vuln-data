    "Title": "CVE-2019-14870 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the S4U (MS-SFU) Kerberos delegation model includes a feature allowing for a subset of clients to be opted out of constrained delegation in any way, either S4U2Self or regular Kerberos authentication, by forcing all tickets for these clients to be non-forwardable. In AD this is implemented by a user attribute delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated), which translates to disallow-forwardable. However the Samba AD DC does not do that for S4U2Self and does set the forwardable flag even if the impersonated client has the not-delegated flag set.",
