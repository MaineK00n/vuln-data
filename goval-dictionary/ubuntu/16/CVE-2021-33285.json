    "Title": "CVE-2021-33285 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "In NTFS-3G versions \u003c 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute is supplied to the function ntfs_get_attribute_value, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for memory disclosure or denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root cause is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT record : the \"bytes_in_use\" field should be less than the \"bytes_allocated\" field. When it is not, the parsing of the records proceeds into the wild.",
