    "Title": "CVE-2016-2195 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "Integer overflow in the PointGFp constructor in Botan before 1.10.11 and 1.11.x before 1.11.27 allows remote attackers to overwrite memory and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ECC point, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. The bigint_mul and bigint_sqr functions received the size of the output buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithm in cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolled multiplication function. The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding, which accepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for remote code execution.",
