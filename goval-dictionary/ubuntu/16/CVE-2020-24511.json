    "Title": "CVE-2020-24511 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "Improper isolation of shared resources in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Joseph Nuzman discovered that some Intel processors may not properly apply EIBRS mitigations (originally developed for CVE-2017-5715) and hence may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.",
