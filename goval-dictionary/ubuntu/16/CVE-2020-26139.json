    "Title": "CVE-2020-26139 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP) forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled EAPOL frames from unauthenticated senders. A physically proximate attacker could inject malicious packets to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
