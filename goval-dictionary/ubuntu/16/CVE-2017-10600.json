    "Description": "ubuntu-image 1.0 before 2017-07-07, when invoked as non-root, creates files in the resulting image with the uid of the invoking user. When the resulting image is booted, a local attacker with the same uid as the image creator has unintended access to cloud-init and snapd directories. ubuntu-image 1.0 when invoked as non-root on systems with e2fsprogs \u003e= 1.43 creates file permissions in the resulting image with the UID of the invoking user. When the resulting image is booted, a local attacker with the same UID as the image creator can alter installed snap packages and signatures to downgrade or potentially replace snap packages.",
