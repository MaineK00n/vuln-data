    "Title": "CVE-2021-38203 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "btrfs in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via processes that trigger allocation of new system chunks during times when there is a shortage of free space in the system space_info. Naohiro Aota discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in situations that triggered allocations of new system chunks. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (deadlock).",
