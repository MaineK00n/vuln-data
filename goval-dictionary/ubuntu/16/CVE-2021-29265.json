    "Title": "CVE-2021-29265 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.7. usbip_sockfd_store in drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status, aka CID-9380afd6df70. It was discovered that the USB/IP driver in the Linux kernel contained race conditions during the update of local and shared status. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
