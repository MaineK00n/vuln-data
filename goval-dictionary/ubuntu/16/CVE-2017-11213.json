    "Title": "CVE-2017-11213 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Flash Player 27.0.0.183 and earlier versions. This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer due to an integer overflow; the computation is part of the abstraction that creates an arbitrarily sized transparent or opaque bitmap image. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.",
