    "Title": "CVE-2020-27762 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/hdr.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned char`. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to ImageMagick 7.0.8-68.",
