    "Description": "Monit before version 5.20.0 is vulnerable to a cross site request forgery attack. Successful exploitation will enable an attacker to disable/enable all monitoring for a particular host or disable/enable monitoring for a specific service. It was discovered that the Monit web interface did not protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. If an authenticated user were tricked into visiting a malicious website while logged into Monit, a remote attacker could perform administrative actions.",
