    "Title": "CVE-2020-0570 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
    "Description": "QLibrary in Qt versions 5.12.0 through 5.14.0, on certain x86 machines, would search for certain libraries and plugins relative to current working directory of the application, which allows an attacker that can place files in the file system and influence the working directory of Qt-based applications to load and execute malicious code. This issue was verified on Linux and probably affects all Unix operating systems, other than macOS (Darwin). This issue does not affect Windows.",
