    "Title": "CVE-2020-11934 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
    "Description": "A sandbox escape vulnerability was found in the snapctl user-open (xdg-open) implementation. By adding a directory controlled by the snap to $XDG_DATA_DIRS, it allows the snap to control how the host system xdg-open script opens the URL. It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable when calling the system xdg-open. A malicious snap could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to control how the host system xdg-open script opens the URL. This issue did not affect Ubuntu Core systems. (CVE-2020-11934)",
