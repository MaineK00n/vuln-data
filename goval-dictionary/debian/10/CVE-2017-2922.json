    "Description": "An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket protocol implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted websocket packet can cause a buffer to be allocated while leaving stale pointers which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted websocket packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.",
