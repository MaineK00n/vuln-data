    "Description": "The (1) memc_save_get_next_page, (2) tmemc_restore_put_page and (3) tmemc_restore_flush_page functions in the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) in Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 do not check for negative id pools, which allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and host crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this issue was originally published as part of CVE-2012-3497, which was too general; CVE-2012-3497 has been SPLIT into this ID and others.",
