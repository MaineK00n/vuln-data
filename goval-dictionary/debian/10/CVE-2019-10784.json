    "Description": "phppgadmin through 7.12.1 allows sensitive actions to be performed without validating that the request originated from the application. One such area, \"database.php\" does not verify the source of an HTTP request. This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page with a CSRF exploit and execute arbitrary system commands on the server.",
