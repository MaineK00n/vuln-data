    "Title": "CVE-2017-9047 libxml2",
    "Description": "A buffer overflow was discovered in libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. The variable len is assigned strlen(buf). If the content-\u003etype is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then (i) the content-\u003eprefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon (ii) content-\u003ename is written to the buffer. However, the check for whether the content-\u003ename actually fits also uses 'len' rather than the updated buffer length strlen(buf). This allows us to write about \"size\" many bytes beyond the allocated memory. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.",
