    "Description": "In FreeBSD 12.0-STABLE before r350828, 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p10, 11.3-STABLE before r350829, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p3, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p14, a missing check in the function to arrange data in a chain of mbufs could cause data returned not to be contiguous. Extra checks in the IPv6 stack could catch the error condition and trigger a kernel panic, leading to a remote denial of service.",
