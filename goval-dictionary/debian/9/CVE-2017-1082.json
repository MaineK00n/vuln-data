    "Description": "In FreeBSD 11.x before 11.1-RELEASE and 10.x before 10.4-RELEASE, the qsort algorithm has a deterministic recursion pattern. Feeding a pathological input to the algorithm can lead to excessive stack usage and potential overflow. Applications that use qsort to handle large data set may crash if the input follows the pathological pattern.",
