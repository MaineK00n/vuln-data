    "Description": "OpenVPN before 2.0.1, when running with \"verb 0\" and without TLS authentication, does not properly flush the OpenSSL error queue when a client fails certificate authentication to the server and causes the error to be processed by the wrong client, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client disconnection) via a large number of failed authentication attempts.",
