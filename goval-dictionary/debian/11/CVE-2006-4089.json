    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflows in Andy Lo-A-Foe AlsaPlayer 0.99.76 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash), or have other unknown impact, via (1) a long Location field sent by a web server, which triggers an overflow in the reconnect function in reader/http/http.c; (2) a long URL sent by a web server when AlsaPlayer is seeking a media file for the playlist, which triggers overflows in new_list_item and CbUpdated in interface/gtk/PlaylistWindow.cpp; and (3) a long response sent by a CDDB server, which triggers an overflow in cddb_lookup in input/ccda/cdda_engine.c.",
