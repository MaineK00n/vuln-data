    "Title": "CVE-2019-3882 linux",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable.",
