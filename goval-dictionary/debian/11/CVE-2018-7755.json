    "Title": "CVE-2018-7755 linux",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the fd_locked_ioctl function in drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.7. The floppy driver will copy a kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. An attacker can send the FDGETPRM ioctl and use the obtained kernel pointer to discover the location of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR.",
