    "Title": "CVE-2020-12402 nss",
    "Description": "During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top of it might. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 78.",
