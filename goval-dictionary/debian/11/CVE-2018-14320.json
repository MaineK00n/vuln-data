    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of PoDoFo. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within PdfEncoding::ParseToUnicode. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-5673.",
