    "Title": "CVE-2018-10903 python-cryptography",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in python-cryptography versions between \u003e=1.9.0 and \u003c2.3. The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.",
