    "Title": "RHSA-2011:0423: postfix security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Postfix is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), supporting LDAP, SMTP AUTH (SASL),\nand TLS.\n\nIt was discovered that Postfix did not flush the received SMTP commands\nbuffer after switching to TLS encryption for an SMTP session. A\nman-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to inject SMTP commands into\na victim's session during the plain text phase. This would lead to those\ncommands being processed by Postfix after TLS encryption is enabled,\npossibly allowing the attacker to steal the victim's mail or authentication\ncredentials. (CVE-2011-0411)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2011-0411. The\nCERT/CC acknowledges Wietse Venema as the original reporter.\n\nUsers of Postfix are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this\nupdate, the postfix service will be restarted automatically.",
