    "Description": "The 389-ds-base packages provide 389 Directory Server, which is an LDAPv3\ncompliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory\nAccess Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server\nadministration.\n\nA flaw was found in the way 389 Directory Server enforced ACLs after\nperforming an LDAP modify relative distinguished name (modrdn) operation.\nAfter modrdn was used to move part of a tree, the ACLs defined on the moved\n(Distinguished Name) were not properly enforced until the server was\nrestarted. This could allow LDAP users to access information that should be\nrestricted by the defined ACLs. (CVE-2012-4450)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Noriko Hosoi of Red Hat.\n\nThese updated 389-ds-base packages include numerous bug fixes and\nenhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this\nadvisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4\nTechnical Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most\nsignificant of these changes.\n\nAll users of 389-ds-base are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct this issue and provide numerous bug fixes and enhancements.\nAfter installing this update, the 389 server service will be restarted\nautomatically.",
