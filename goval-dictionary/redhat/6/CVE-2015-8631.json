    "Title": "RHSA-2016:0493: krb5 security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Kerberos is a networked authentication system which allows clients and\nservers to authenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third\nparty, the Kerberos KDC.\n\nA memory leak flaw was found in the krb5_unparse_name() function of the MIT\nKerberos kadmind service. An authenticated attacker could repeatedly send\nspecially crafted requests to the server, which could cause the server to\nconsume large amounts of memory resources, ultimately leading to a denial\nof service due to memory exhaustion. (CVE-2015-8631)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the kadmind service of MIT\nKerberos. An authenticated attacker could send a maliciously crafted\nmessage to force kadmind to read beyond the end of allocated memory, and\nwrite the memory contents to the KDC database if the attacker has write\npermission, leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2015-8629)\n\nThe CVE-2015-8631 issue was discovered by Simo Sorce of Red Hat.\n\nAll krb5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdated packages, running Kerberos services (krb5kdc, kadmin, and kprop)\nwill be restarted automatically.",
