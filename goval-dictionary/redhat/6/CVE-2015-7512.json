    "Title": "RHSA-2015:2694: qemu-kvm security update (Important)",
    "Description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm package provides the\nuser-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the way QEMU's AMD\nPC-Net II Ethernet Controller emulation received certain packets in\nloopback mode. A privileged user (with the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability) inside\na guest could use this flaw to crash the host QEMU process (resulting in\ndenial of service) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with privileges\nof the host QEMU process. (CVE-2015-7504)\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's AMD PC-Net II emulation\nvalidated certain received packets from a remote host in non-loopback mode.\nA remote, unprivileged attacker could potentially use this flaw to execute\narbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.\nNote that to exploit this flaw, the guest network interface must have a\nlarge MTU limit. (CVE-2015-7512)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Marvel Team and Ling\nLiu of Qihoo 360 Inc. for reporting the CVE-2015-7504 issue, and Ling Liu\nof Qihoo 360 Inc. for reporting the CVE-2015-7512 issue. The CVE-2015-7512\nissue was independently discovered by Jason Wang of Red Hat.\n\nAll qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this\nupdate, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines\nhave shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.",
