    "Title": "RHSA-2011:1532: kexec-tools security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Kexec allows for booting a Linux kernel from the context of an already\nrunning kernel.\n\nKdump used the SSH (Secure Shell) \"StrictHostKeyChecking=no\" option when\ndumping to SSH targets, causing the target kdump server's SSH host key not\nto be checked. This could make it easier for a man-in-the-middle attacker\non the local network to impersonate the kdump SSH target server and\npossibly gain access to sensitive information in the vmcore dumps.\n(CVE-2011-3588)\n\nmkdumprd created initrd files with world-readable permissions. A local user\ncould possibly use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information, such\nas the private SSH key used to authenticate to a remote server when kdump\nwas configured to dump to an SSH target. (CVE-2011-3589)\n\nmkdumprd included unneeded sensitive files (such as all files from the\n\"/root/.ssh/\" directory and the host's private SSH keys) in the resulting\ninitrd. This could lead to an information leak when initrd files were\npreviously created with world-readable permissions. Note: With this update,\nonly the SSH client configuration, known hosts files, and the SSH key\nconfigured via the newly introduced sshkey option in \"/etc/kdump.conf\" are\nincluded in the initrd. The default is the key generated when running the\n\"service kdump propagate\" command, \"/root/.ssh/kdump_id_rsa\".\n(CVE-2011-3590)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Kevan Carstensen for reporting these issues.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.\nSpace precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory.\nDocumentation for these bug fixes and enhancements will be available\nshortly from the Technical Notes document, linked to in the References\nsection.\n\nAll kexec-tools users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues and add these\nenhancements.",
