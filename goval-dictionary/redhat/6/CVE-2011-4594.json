    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0350: kernel security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's XFS file\nsystem implementation handled links with overly long path names. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or\nescalate their privileges by mounting a specially-crafted disk.\n(CVE-2011-4077, Moderate)\n\n* Flaws in ghash_update() and ghash_final() could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4081, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Journaling Block Device (JBD). A\nlocal, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system by\nmounting a specially-crafted ext3 or ext4 disk. (CVE-2011-4132, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the kvm_vm_ioctl_assign_device() function in the KVM\n(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem of a Linux kernel did not check if\nthe user requesting device assignment was privileged or not. A local,\nunprivileged user on the host could assign unused PCI devices, or even\ndevices that were in use and whose resources were not properly claimed by\nthe respective drivers, which could result in the host crashing.\n(CVE-2011-4347, Moderate)\n\n* Two flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's __sys_sendmsg()\nfunction, when invoked via the sendmmsg() system call, accessed user-space\nmemory. A local, unprivileged user could use these flaws to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2011-4594, Moderate)\n\n* The RHSA-2011:1530 kernel update introduced an integer overflow flaw in\nthe Linux kernel. On PowerPC systems, a local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4611, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the KVM subsystem of a Linux kernel handled\nPIT (Programmable Interval Timer) IRQs (interrupt requests) when there was\nno virtual interrupt controller set up. A local, unprivileged user on the\nhost could force this situation to occur, resulting in the host crashing.\n(CVE-2011-4622, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's XFS file system\nimplementation handled on-disk Access Control Lists (ACLs). A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or\nescalate their privileges by mounting a specially-crafted disk.\n(CVE-2012-0038, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor\nimplementation emulated the syscall instruction for 32-bit guests. An\nunprivileged guest user could trigger this flaw to crash the guest.\n(CVE-2012-0045, Moderate)\n\n* A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the Linux kernel's igmp_heard_query()\nfunction. An attacker able to send certain IGMP (Internet Group Management\nProtocol) packets to a target system could use this flaw to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2012-0207, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Nick Bowler for reporting CVE-2011-4081; Sasha\nLevin for reporting CVE-2011-4347; Tetsuo Handa for reporting\nCVE-2011-4594; Maynard Johnson for reporting CVE-2011-4611; Wang Xi for\nreporting CVE-2012-0038; Stephan BÃ¤rwolf for reporting CVE-2012-0045; and\nSimon McVittie for reporting CVE-2012-0207. Upstream acknowledges Mathieu\nDesnoyers as the original reporter of CVE-2011-4594.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will\nbe available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the\nReferences section.\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical\nNotes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.",
