    "Title": "RHSA-2014:1803: mod_auth_mellon security update (Important)",
    "Description": "mod_auth_mellon provides a SAML 2.0 authentication module for the Apache\nHTTP Server.\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in mod_auth_mellon's session\nhandling that could lead to sessions overlapping in memory. A remote\nattacker could potentially use this flaw to obtain data from another user's\nsession. (CVE-2014-8566)\n\nIt was found that uninitialized data could be read when processing a user's\nlogout request. By attempting to log out, a user could possibly cause the\nApache HTTP Server to crash. (CVE-2014-8567)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the mod_auth_mellon team for reporting these\nissues. Upstream acknowledges Matthew Slowe as the original reporter of\nCVE-2014-8566.\n\nAll users of mod_auth_mellon are advised to upgrade to this updated\npackage, which contains a backported patch to correct these issues.",
