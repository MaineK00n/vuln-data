    "Description": "Python Paste provides middleware for building and running Python web\napplications. The python-paste-script package includes paster, a tool for\nworking with and running Python Paste applications.\n\nIt was discovered that paster did not drop supplementary group privileges\nwhen started by the root user. Running \"paster serve\" as root to start a\nPython web application that will run as a non-root user and group resulted\nin that application running with root group privileges. This could possibly\nallow a remote attacker to gain access to files that should not be\naccessible to the application. (CVE-2012-0878)\n\nAll paster users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to resolve this issue. All running paster instances\nconfigured to drop privileges must be restarted for this update to take\neffect.",
