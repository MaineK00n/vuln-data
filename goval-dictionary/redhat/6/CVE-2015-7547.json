    "Title": "RHSA-2016:0175: glibc security and bug fix update (Critical)",
    "Description": "The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread\nlibraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name\nServer Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.\nWithout these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the libresolv library\nperformed dual A/AAAA DNS queries. A remote attacker could create a\nspecially crafted DNS response which could cause libresolv to crash or,\npotentially, execute code with the permissions of the user running the\nlibrary. Note: this issue is only exposed when libresolv is called from the\nnss_dns NSS service module. (CVE-2015-7547)\n\nThis issue was discovered by the Google Security Team and Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The dynamic loader has been enhanced to allow the loading of more shared\nlibraries that make use of static thread local storage. While static thread\nlocal storage is the fastest access mechanism it may also prevent the\nshared library from being loaded at all since the static storage space is a\nlimited and shared process-global resource. Applications which would\npreviously fail with \"dlopen: cannot load any more object with static TLS\"\nshould now start up correctly. (BZ#1291270)\n\n* A bug in the POSIX realtime support would cause asynchronous I/O or\ncertain timer API calls to fail and return errors in the presence of large\nthread-local storage data that exceeded PTHREAD_STACK_MIN in size\n(generally 16 KiB). The bug in librt has been corrected and the impacted\nAPIs no longer return errors when large thread-local storage data is\npresent in the application. (BZ#1301625)\n\nAll glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
