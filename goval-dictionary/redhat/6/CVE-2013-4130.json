    "Title": "RHSA-2013:1192: spice-server security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a\nremote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a\nvirtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with\nnetwork access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for\nviewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine\n(KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.\n\nA flaw was found in the way concurrent access to the clients ring buffer\nwas performed in the spice-server library. A remote user able to initiate a\nSPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server could use this\nflaw to crash the application. (CVE-2013-4130)\n\nThis issue was discovered by David Gibson of Red Hat.\n\nUsers of spice-server are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue. Applications acting as a\nSPICE server must be restarted for this update to take effect. Note that\nQEMU-KVM guests providing SPICE console access must be restarted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
