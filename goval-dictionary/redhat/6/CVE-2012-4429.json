    "Title": "RHSA-2013:0169: vino security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Vino is a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server for GNOME. It allows\nremote users to connect to a running GNOME session using VNC.\n\nIt was found that Vino transmitted all clipboard activity on the system\nrunning Vino to all clients connected to port 5900, even those who had not\nauthenticated. A remote attacker who is able to access port 5900 on a\nsystem running Vino could use this flaw to read clipboard data without\nauthenticating. (CVE-2012-4429)\n\nTwo out-of-bounds memory read flaws were found in the way Vino processed\nclient framebuffer requests in certain encodings. An authenticated client\ncould use these flaws to send a specially-crafted request to Vino, causing\nit to crash. (CVE-2011-0904, CVE-2011-0905)\n\nIn certain circumstances, the vino-preferences dialog box incorrectly\nindicated that Vino was only accessible from the local network. This could\nconfuse a user into believing connections from external networks are not\nallowed (even when they are allowed). With this update, vino-preferences no\nlonger displays connectivity and reachable information. (CVE-2011-1164)\n\nThere was no warning that Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) was used to open\nports on a user's network router when the \"Configure network automatically\nto accept connections\" option was enabled (it is disabled by default) in\nthe Vino preferences. This update changes the option's description to avoid\nthe risk of a UPnP router configuration change without the user's consent.\n(CVE-2011-1165)\n\nAll Vino users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. The GNOME session must be\nrestarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.",
