    "Title": "RHSA-2016:0741: openssh security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation supported by a number of Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was found that the OpenSSH client did not properly enforce the ForwardX11Timeout setting. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. (CVE-2015-5352)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled PAM authentication when using privilege separation. An attacker with valid credentials on the system and able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could use this flaw to authenticate as other users. (CVE-2015-6563)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in OpenSSH. An attacker able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could possibly cause sshd to crash or execute arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2015-6564)\n\n* An access flaw was discovered in OpenSSH; the OpenSSH client did not correctly handle failures to generate authentication cookies for untrusted X11 forwarding. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. (CVE-2016-1908)\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 Release Notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 Technical Notes linked from the References section.",
