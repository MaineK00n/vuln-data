    "Title": "RHSA-2013:1120: haproxy security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "HAProxy provides high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP\nand HTTP-based applications.\n\nA flaw was found in the way HAProxy handled requests when the proxy's\nconfiguration (\"/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg\") had certain rules that use the\nhdr_ip criterion. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash HAProxy\ninstances that use the affected configuration. (CVE-2013-2175)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank HAProxy upstream for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges David Torgerson as the original reporter.\n\nHAProxy is released as a Technology Preview in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\nMore information about Red Hat Technology Previews is available at\nhttps://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/\n\nAll users of haproxy are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue.",
