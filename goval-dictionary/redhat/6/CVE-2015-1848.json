    "Title": "RHSA-2015:0990: pcs security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The pcs packages provide a command-line tool and a web UI to configure and\nmanage the Pacemaker and Corosync tools.\n\nIt was found that the pcs daemon did not sign cookies containing session\ndata that were sent to clients connecting via the pcsd web UI. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to forge cookies and bypass authorization\nchecks, possibly gaining elevated privileges in the pcsd web UI. Note: the\npcsd web UI is not enabled by default. (CVE-2015-1848)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Tomas Jelinek of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* When the IPv6 protocol was disabled on a system, starting the pcsd daemon\non this system previously failed. This update adds the ability for pcsd to\nfall back to IPv4 when IPv6 is not available. As a result, pcsd starts\nproperly and uses IPv4 if IPv6 is disabled. (BZ#1212115)\n\nAll pcs users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdated packages, the pcsd daemon will be restarted automatically.",
