    "Title": "RHSA-2017:0794: quagga security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The quagga packages contain Quagga, the free network-routing software suite that manages TCP/IP based protocols. Quagga supports the BGP4, BGP4+, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, RIPv1, RIPv2, and RIPng protocols, and is intended to be used as a Route Server and Route Reflector.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Quagga handled IPv6 router advertisement messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the zebra daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2016-1245)\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Quagga BGP routing daemon (bgpd) handled Labeled-VPN SAFI routes data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the bgpd daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2016-2342)\n\n* A denial of service flaw was found in the Quagga BGP routing daemon (bgpd). Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could send a crafted packet to crash the bgpd daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2016-4049)\n\n* A denial of service flaw affecting various daemons in Quagga was found. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the various Quagga daemons, which expose their telnet interface, to crash. (CVE-2017-5495)\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Quagga OSPFD daemon handled LSA (link-state advertisement) packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the ospfd daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2013-2236)\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 Release Notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 Technical Notes linked from the References section.",
