    "Description": "Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic. Wireshark was\npreviously known as Ethereal.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Wireshark MAC-LTE\ndissector. If Wireshark read a malformed packet off a network or opened a\nmalicious dump file, it could crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as\nthe user running Wireshark. (CVE-2011-0444)\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Wireshark processed\nsignaling traces generated by the Gammu utility on Nokia DCT3 phones\nrunning in Netmonitor mode. If Wireshark opened a specially-crafted capture\nfile, it could crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user\nrunning Wireshark. (CVE-2011-0713)\n\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could\ncrash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or\nopened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2011-0538, CVE-2011-1139, CVE-2011-1140,\nCVE-2011-1141)\n\nUsers of Wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nWireshark version 1.2.15, and resolve these issues. All running instances\nof Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
