    "Title": "RHSA-2015:2636: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's file system implementation\nhandled rename operations in which the source was inside and the\ndestination was outside of a bind mount. A privileged user inside a\ncontainer could use this flaw to escape the bind mount and, potentially,\nescalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-2925, Important)\n\n* It was found that the x86 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is prone to\na denial of service attack inside a virtualized environment in the form of\nan infinite loop in the microcode due to the way (sequential) delivering of\nbenign exceptions such as #AC (alignment check exception) and #DB (debug\nexception) is handled. A privileged user inside a guest could use these\nflaws to create denial of service conditions on the host kernel.\n(CVE-2015-5307, CVE-2015-8104, Important)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPC\nsubsystem initialized certain fields in an IPC object structure that were\nlater used for permission checking before inserting the object into a\nglobally visible list. A local, unprivileged user could potentially use\nthis flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-7613,\nImportant)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's keys subsystem did not correctly\ngarbage collect uninstantiated keyrings. A local attacker could use this\nflaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on\nthe system. (CVE-2015-7872, Important)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ben Serebrin of Google Inc. for reporting the\nCVE-2015-5307 issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, Human Interface Device (HID) ran a report on an unaligned\nbuffer, which could cause a page fault interrupt and an oops when the end\nof the report was read. This update fixes this bug by padding the end of\nthe report with extra bytes, so the reading of the report never crosses a\npage boundary. As a result, a page fault and subsequent oops no longer\noccur. (BZ#1268203)\n\n* The NFS client was previously failing to detect a directory loop for some\nNFS server directory structures. This failure could cause NFS inodes to\nremain referenced after attempting to unmount the file system, leading to a\nkernel crash. Loop checks have been added to VFS, which effectively\nprevents this problem from occurring. (BZ#1272858)\n\n* Due to a race whereby the nfs_wb_pages_cancel() and\nnfs_commit_release_pages() calls both removed a request from the nfs_inode\nstruct type, the kernel panicked with negative nfs_inode.npages count.\nThe provided upstream patch performs the required serialization by holding\nthe inode i_lock over the check of PagePrivate and locking the request,\nthus preventing the race and kernel panic from occurring. (BZ#1273721)\n\n* Due to incorrect URB_ISO_ASAP semantics, playing an audio file using a\nUSB sound card could previously fail for some hardware configurations.\nThis update fixes the bug, and playing audio from a USB sound card now\nworks as expected. (BZ#1273916)\n\n* Inside hugetlb, region data structures were protected by a combination of\na memory map semaphore and a single hugetlb instance mutex. However, a\npage-fault scalability improvement backported to the kernel on previous\nreleases removed the single hugetlb instance mutex and introduced a new\nmutex table, making the locking combination insufficient, leading to\npossible race windows that could cause corruption and undefined behavior.\nThis update fixes the problem by introducing a required spinlock to the\nregion tracking functions for proper serialization. The problem only\naffects software using huge pages through hugetlb interface. (BZ#1274599)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
