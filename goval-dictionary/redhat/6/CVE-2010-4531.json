    "Title": "RHSA-2013:0525: pcsc-lite security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "PC/SC Lite provides a Windows SCard compatible interface for communicating\nwith smart cards, smart card readers, and other security tokens.\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way pcsc-lite decoded\ncertain attribute values of Answer-to-Reset (ATR) messages. A local\nattacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the user running the pcscd daemon (root, by default), by inserting a\nspecially-crafted smart card. (CVE-2010-4531)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Due to an error in the init script, the chkconfig utility did not\nautomatically place the pcscd init script after the start of the HAL\ndaemon. Consequently, the pcscd service did not start automatically at boot\ntime. With this update, the pcscd init script has been changed to\nexplicitly start only after HAL is up, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#788474,\nBZ#814549)\n\n* Because the chkconfig settings and the startup files in the /etc/rc.d/\ndirectory were not changed during the update described in the\nRHBA-2012:0990 advisory, the user had to update the chkconfig settings\nmanually to fix the problem. Now, the chkconfig settings and the startup\nfiles in the /etc/rc.d/ directory are automatically updated as expected.\n(BZ#834803)\n\n* Previously, the SCardGetAttrib() function did not work properly and\nalways returned the \"SCARD_E_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER\" error regardless of the\nactual buffer size. This update applies a patch to fix this bug and the\nSCardGetAttrib() function now works as expected. (BZ#891852)\n\nAll users of pcsc-lite are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich fix these issues. After installing this update, the pcscd daemon will\nbe restarted automatically.",
