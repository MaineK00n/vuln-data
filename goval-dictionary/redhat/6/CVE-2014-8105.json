    "Title": "RHSA-2015:0628: 389-ds-base security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Important)",
    "Description": "The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages\ninclude the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and\ncommand-line utilities for server administration.\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way the 389 Directory\nServer stored information in the Changelog that is exposed via the\n'cn=changelog' LDAP sub-tree. An unauthenticated user could in certain\ncases use this flaw to read data from the Changelog, which could include\nsensitive information such as plain-text passwords. (CVE-2014-8105)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Petr Špaček of the Red Hat Identity Management\nEngineering Team.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* In multi-master replication (MMR), deleting a single-valued attribute of\na Directory Server (DS) entry was previously in some cases not correctly\nreplicated. Consequently, the entry state in the replica systems did not\nreflect the intended changes. This bug has been fixed and the removal of a\nsingle-valued attribute is now properly replicated. (BZ#1179099)\n\n* Prior to this update, the Directory Server (DS) always checked the ACI\nsyntax. As a consequence, removing an ACI failed with a syntax error.\nWith this update, the ACI check is stopped when the ACI is going to be\nremoved, and the removal thus works as expected. (BZ#1179100)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancement:\n\n* The buffer size limit for the 389-ds-base application has been increased\nto 2MB in order to match the buffer size limit of Simple Authentication and\nSecurity Layer (SASL) and Basic Encoding Rules (BER). (BZ#1179595)\n\nAll 389-ds-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this\nenhancement. After installing this update, the 389 server service will be\nrestarted automatically.",
