    "Title": "RHSA-2014:0771: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled\nthe requeuing of certain Priority Inheritance (PI) futexes. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the\nsystem. (CVE-2014-3153, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's floppy driver handled user\nspace provided data in certain error code paths while processing FDRAWCMD\nIOCTL commands. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this\nflaw to free (using the kfree() function) arbitrary kernel memory.\n(CVE-2014-1737, Important)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's floppy driver leaked internal kernel\nmemory addresses to user space during the processing of the FDRAWCMD IOCTL\ncommand. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to\nobtain information about the kernel heap arrangement. (CVE-2014-1738, Low)\n\nNote: A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use these two flaws\n(CVE-2014-1737 in combination with CVE-2014-1738) to escalate their\nprivileges on the system.\n\n* It was discovered that the proc_ns_follow_link() function did not\nproperly return the LAST_BIND value in the last pathname component as is\nexpected for procfs symbolic links, which could lead to excessive freeing\nof memory and consequent slab corruption. A local, unprivileged user could\nuse this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-0203, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled exceptions when\nuser-space applications attempted to use the linkage stack. On IBM S/390\nsystems, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the\nsystem. (CVE-2014-2039, Moderate)\n\n* An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in the Marvell 8xxx\nLibertas WLAN (libertas) driver in the Linux kernel. A local user able to\nwrite to a file that is provided by the libertas driver and located on the\ndebug file system (debugfs) could use this flaw to crash the system. Note:\nThe debugfs file system must be mounted locally to exploit this issue.\nIt is not mounted by default. (CVE-2013-6378, Low)\n\n* A denial of service flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel's\nSELinux implementation handled files with an empty SELinux security\ncontext. A local user who has the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability could use this\nflaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-1874, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Kees Cook of Google for reporting\nCVE-2014-3153, Matthew Daley for reporting CVE-2014-1737 and CVE-2014-1738,\nand Vladimir Davydov of Parallels for reporting CVE-2014-0203. Google\nacknowledges Pinkie Pie as the original reporter of CVE-2014-3153.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will\nbe available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the\nReferences section.\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
