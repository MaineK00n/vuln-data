    "Title": "RHSA-2013:1272: libvirt security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the\nvirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In\naddition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized\nsystems.\n\nlibvirt invokes the PolicyKit pkcheck utility to handle authorization. A\nrace condition was found in the way libvirt used this utility, allowing a\nlocal user to bypass intended PolicyKit authorizations or execute arbitrary\ncommands with root privileges. (CVE-2013-4311)\n\nNote: With this update, libvirt has been rebuilt to communicate with\nPolicyKit via a different API that is not vulnerable to the race condition.\nThe polkit RHSA-2013:1270 advisory must also be installed to fix the\nCVE-2013-4311 issue.\n\nAn invalid free flaw was found in libvirtd's\nremoteDispatchDomainMemoryStats function. An attacker able to establish a\nread-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd.\n(CVE-2013-4296)\n\nThe CVE-2013-4296 issue was discovered by Daniel P. Berrange of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the libvirtd daemon leaked memory in the\nvirCgroupMoveTask() function. A fix has been provided which prevents\nlibvirtd from incorrect management of memory allocations. (BZ#984556)\n\n* Previously, the libvirtd daemon was accessing one byte before the array\nin the virCgroupGetValueStr() function. This bug has been fixed and\nlibvirtd now stays within the array bounds. (BZ#984561)\n\n* When migrating, libvirtd leaked the migration URI (Uniform Resource\nIdentifier) on destination. A patch has been provided to fix this bug and\nthe migration URI is now freed correctly. (BZ#984578)\n\n* Updating a network interface using virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags API failed\nwhen a boot order was set for that interface. The update failed even if the\nboot order was set in the provided device XML. The\nvirDomainUpdateDeviceFlags API has been fixed to correctly parse the boot\norder specification from the provided device XML and updating network\ninterfaces with boot orders now works as expected. (BZ#1003934)\n\nUsers of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.",
