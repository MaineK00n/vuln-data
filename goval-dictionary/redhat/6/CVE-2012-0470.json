    "Description": "Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL\nRuntime environment for Mozilla Firefox.\n\nA flaw was found in Sanitiser for OpenType (OTS), used by Firefox to help\nprevent potential exploits in malformed OpenType fonts. A web page\ncontaining malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, under certain\nconditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning Firefox. (CVE-2011-3062)\n\nA web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nFirefox. (CVE-2012-0467, CVE-2012-0468, CVE-2012-0469)\n\nA web page containing a malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file\ncould cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0470)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox used its embedded Cairo library to\nrender certain fonts. A web page containing malicious content could cause\nFirefox to crash or, under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0472)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox rendered certain images using WebGL. A\nweb page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,\nunder certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0478)\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Firefox handled\ncertain multibyte character sets. A web page containing malicious content\ncould cause Firefox to run JavaScript code with the permissions of a\ndifferent website. (CVE-2012-0471)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox rendered certain graphics using WebGL.\nA web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash.\n(CVE-2012-0473)\n\nA flaw in Firefox allowed the address bar to display a different website\nthan the one the user was visiting. An attacker could use this flaw to\nconceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user into believing they are\nviewing a trusted site, or allowing scripts to be loaded from the\nattacker's site, possibly leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n(CVE-2012-0474)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox decoded the ISO-2022-KR and ISO-2022-CN\ncharacter sets. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox\nto run JavaScript code with the permissions of a different website.\n(CVE-2012-0477)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled RSS and Atom feeds. Invalid\nRSS or Atom content loaded over HTTPS caused Firefox to display the\naddress of said content in the location bar, but not the content in the\nmain window. The previous content continued to be displayed. An attacker\ncould use this flaw to perform phishing attacks, or trick users into\nthinking they are visiting the site reported by the location bar, when the\npage is actually content controlled by an attacker. (CVE-2012-0479)\n\nFor technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security\nadvisories for Firefox 10.0.4 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla\nadvisories in the References section of this erratum.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security Team as the\noriginal reporter of CVE-2011-3062; Aki Helin from OUSPG as the original\nreporter of CVE-2012-0469; Atte Kettunen from OUSPG as the original\nreporter of CVE-2012-0470; wushi of team509 via iDefense as the original\nreporter of CVE-2012-0472; Ms2ger as the original reporter of\nCVE-2012-0478; Anne van Kesteren of Opera Software as the original reporter\nof CVE-2012-0471; Matias Juntunen as the original reporter of\nCVE-2012-0473; Jordi Chancel and Eddy Bordi, and Chris McGowen as the\noriginal reporters of CVE-2012-0474; Masato Kinugawa as the original\nreporter of CVE-2012-0477; and Jeroen van der Gun as the original reporter\nof CVE-2012-0479.",
