    "Title": "RHSA-2015:0066: openssl security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),\nTransport Layer Security (TLS), and Datagram Transport Layer Security\n(DTLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography\nlibrary.\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the DTLS implementation of\nOpenSSL. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted DTLS message,\nwhich would cause an OpenSSL server to crash. (CVE-2014-3571)\n\nA memory leak flaw was found in the way the dtls1_buffer_record() function\nof OpenSSL parsed certain DTLS messages. A remote attacker could send\nmultiple specially crafted DTLS messages to exhaust all available memory of\na DTLS server. (CVE-2015-0206)\n\nIt was found that OpenSSL's BigNumber Squaring implementation could produce\nincorrect results under certain special conditions. This flaw could\npossibly affect certain OpenSSL library functionality, such as RSA\nblinding. Note that this issue occurred rarely and with a low probability,\nand there is currently no known way of exploiting it. (CVE-2014-3570)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL would perform an ECDH key exchange with a\nnon-ephemeral key even when the ephemeral ECDH cipher suite was selected.\nA malicious server could make a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL use a weaker\nkey exchange method than the one requested by the user. (CVE-2014-3572)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL would accept ephemeral RSA keys when using\nnon-export RSA cipher suites. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL\nclient using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method. (CVE-2015-0204)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way OpenSSL parsed X.509 certificates.\nAn attacker could use these flaws to modify an X.509 certificate to produce\na certificate with a different fingerprint without invalidating its\nsignature, and possibly bypass fingerprint-based blacklisting in\napplications. (CVE-2014-8275)\n\nIt was found that an OpenSSL server would, under certain conditions, accept\nDiffie-Hellman client certificates without the use of a private key.\nAn attacker could use a user's client certificate to authenticate as that\nuser, without needing the private key. (CVE-2015-0205)\n\nAll OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to mitigate the above issues. For the update to\ntake effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and\nother SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.",
