    "Title": "RHSA-2014:0788: mod_wsgi security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The mod_wsgi adapter is an Apache module that provides a WSGI-compliant\ninterface for hosting Python-based web applications within Apache.\n\nIt was found that mod_wsgi did not properly drop privileges if the call to\nsetuid() failed. If mod_wsgi was set up to allow unprivileged users to run\nWSGI applications, a local user able to run a WSGI application could\npossibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.\n(CVE-2014-0240)\n\nNote: mod_wsgi is not intended to provide privilege separation for WSGI\napplications. Systems relying on mod_wsgi to limit or sandbox the\nprivileges of mod_wsgi applications should migrate to a different solution\nwith proper privilege separation.\n\nIt was discovered that mod_wsgi could leak memory of a hosted web\napplication via the \"Content-Type\" header. A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this flaw to disclose limited portions of the web application's memory.\n(CVE-2014-0242)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Graham Dumpleton for reporting these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges RÃ³bert Kisteleki as the original reporter of\nCVE-2014-0240, and Buck Golemon as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0242.\n\nAll mod_wsgi users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
