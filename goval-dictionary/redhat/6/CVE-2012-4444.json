    "Title": "RHSA-2012:1580: kernel security, bug fix and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* It was found that the RHSA-2012:0862 update did not correctly fix the\nCVE-2011-4131 issue. A malicious Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)\nserver could return a crafted reply to a GETACL request, causing a denial\nof service on the client. (CVE-2012-2375, Moderate)\n\n* A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the TCP Illinois congestion control\nalgorithm implementation in the Linux kernel. If the TCP Illinois\ncongestion control algorithm were in use (the sysctl\nnet.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control variable set to \"illinois\"), a local,\nunprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2012-4565, Moderate)\n\n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way a new node's hot\nadded memory was propagated to other nodes' zonelists. By utilizing this\nnewly added memory from one of the remaining nodes, a local, unprivileged\nuser could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-5517,\nModerate)\n\n* It was found that the initial release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 did\nnot correctly fix the CVE-2009-4307 issue, a divide-by-zero flaw in the\next4 file system code. A local, unprivileged user with the ability to mount\nan ext4 file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2012-2100, Low)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation\nhandled overlapping, fragmented IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could\npotentially use this flaw to bypass protection mechanisms (such as a\nfirewall or intrusion detection system (IDS)) when sending network packets\nto a target system. (CVE-2012-4444, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Antonios Atlasis working with Beyond Security's\nSecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program and Loganaden Velvindron of AFRINIC\nfor reporting CVE-2012-4444. The CVE-2012-2375 issue was discovered by Jian\nLi of Red Hat, and CVE-2012-4565 was discovered by Rodrigo Freire of Red\nHat.\n\nThis update also fixes numerous bugs and adds one enhancement. Space \nprecludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Documentation\nfor these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat Enterprise \nLinux 6.3 Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues, fix these bugs and add the enhancement \nnoted in the Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update \nto take effect.",
