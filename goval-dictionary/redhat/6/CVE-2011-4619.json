    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0059: openssl security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nIt was discovered that the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)\nprotocol implementation in OpenSSL leaked timing information when\nperforming certain operations. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nflaw to retrieve plain text from the encrypted packets by using a DTLS\nserver as a padding oracle. (CVE-2011-4108)\n\nAn information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation\nin OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could\ncause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly\nsensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.\n(CVE-2011-4576)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the RFC 3779 implementation in\nOpenSSL. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make an application using\nOpenSSL exit unexpectedly by providing a specially-crafted X.509\ncertificate that has malformed RFC 3779 extension data. (CVE-2011-4577)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL\nhandshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume\nan excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.\n(CVE-2011-4619)\n\nAll OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,\nall services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system\nrebooted.",
