    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nAn invalid pointer use flaw was found in OpenSSL's ASN1_TYPE_cmp()\nfunction. A remote attacker could crash a TLS/SSL client or server using\nOpenSSL via a specially crafted X.509 certificate when the\nattacker-supplied certificate was verified by the application.\n(CVE-2015-0286)\n\nAn integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the\nway OpenSSL decoded malformed Base64-encoded inputs. An attacker able to\nmake an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted Base64-encoded\ninput (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application to\ncrash. Note: this flaw is not exploitable via the TLS/SSL protocol because\nthe data being transferred is not Base64-encoded. (CVE-2015-0292)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2\nhandshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\nTLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both\nthe SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL imported malformed\nElliptic Curve private keys. A specially crafted key file could cause an\napplication using OpenSSL to crash when imported. (CVE-2015-0209)\n\nAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way OpenSSL reused certain\nASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could possibly use a specially crafted\nASN.1 structure that, when parsed by an application, would cause that\napplication to crash. (CVE-2015-0287)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenSSL's X.509 certificate\nhandling implementation. A specially crafted X.509 certificate could cause\nan application using OpenSSL to crash if the application attempted to\nconvert the certificate to a certificate request. (CVE-2015-0288)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain\nPKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL\nverify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that\napplication to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not\naffected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0289)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting\nCVE-2015-0286, CVE-2015-0287, CVE-2015-0288, CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0292,\nand CVE-2015-0293.

An attacker can potentially use this flaw to decrypt\nRSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol\nversion, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol\nattack is publicly referred to as DROWN. (CVE-2016-0800)\n\nNote: This issue was addressed by disabling the SSLv2 protocol by default\nwhen using the 'SSLv23' connection methods, and removing support for weak\nSSLv2 cipher suites. For more information, refer to the knowledge base\narticle linked to in the References section.\n\nIt was discovered that the SSLv2 servers using OpenSSL accepted SSLv2\nconnection handshakes that indicated non-zero clear key length for\nnon-export cipher suites.
