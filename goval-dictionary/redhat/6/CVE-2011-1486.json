    "Title": "RHSA-2011:0479: libvirt security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the\nvirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In\naddition, libvirt provides tools for remotely managing virtualized systems.\n\nA flaw was found in the way libvirtd handled error reporting for concurrent\nconnections. A remote attacker able to establish read-only connections to\nlibvirtd on a server could use this flaw to crash libvirtd. (CVE-2011-1486)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, running qemu under a different UID prevented it from\naccessing files with mode 0660 permissions that were owned by a different\nuser, but by a group that qemu was a member of. (BZ#668692)\n\nAll libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdated packages, libvirtd must be restarted (\"service libvirtd restart\")\nfor this update to take effect.",
