    "Description": "The php-pecl-apc packages contain APC (Alternative PHP Cache), the\nframework for caching and optimization of intermediate PHP code.\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the \"apc.php\" script, which\nprovides a detailed analysis of the internal workings of APC and is shipped\nas part of the APC extension documentation. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this flaw to conduct a cross-site scripting attack.\n(CVE-2010-3294)\n\nNote: The administrative script is not deployed upon package installation.\nIt must manually be copied to the web root (the default is\n\"/var/www/html/\", for example).\n\nIn addition, the php-pecl-apc packages have been upgraded to upstream\nversion 3.1.9, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over\nthe previous version. (BZ#662655)\n\nAll users of php-pecl-apc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich fix these issues and add these enhancements. If the \"apc.php\" script\nwas previously deployed in the web root, it must manually be re-deployed to\nreplace the vulnerable version to resolve this issue.",
