    "Title": "RHSA-2015:0867: qemu-kvm security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm package provides the\nuser-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.\n\nIt was found that the Cirrus blit region checks were insufficient. A\nprivileged guest user could use this flaw to write outside of VRAM-\nallocated buffer boundaries in the host's QEMU process address space with\nattacker-provided data. (CVE-2014-8106)\n\nThis issue was found by Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, the effective downtime during the last phase of a live\nmigration would sometimes be much higher than the maximum downtime\nspecified by 'migration_downtime' in vdsm.conf. This problem has been\ncorrected. The value of 'migration_downtime' is now honored and the\nmigration is aborted if the downtime cannot be achieved. (BZ#1142756)\n\nAll qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this\nupdate, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines\nhave shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.",
