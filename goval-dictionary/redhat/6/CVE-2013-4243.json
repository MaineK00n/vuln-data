    "Title": "RHSA-2014:0222: libtiff security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged\nImage File Format (TIFF) files.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow and a use-after-free flaw were found in the\ntiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially\ncrafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2013-1960, CVE-2013-4232)\n\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker\ncould use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could\ncause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2013-4231, CVE-2013-4243, CVE-2013-4244)\n\nA flaw was found in the way libtiff handled OJPEG-encoded TIFF images. An\nattacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted TIFF file that\nwould cause an application using libtiff to crash. (CVE-2010-2596)\n\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker\ncould use these flaws to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would\ncause tiff2pdf to crash. (CVE-2013-1961)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NCI Agency for reporting\nCVE-2013-1960 and CVE-2013-1961. The CVE-2013-4243 issue was discovered by\nMurray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the\nCVE-2013-4244 issue was discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nAll libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. All running\napplications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this update to\ntake effect.",
