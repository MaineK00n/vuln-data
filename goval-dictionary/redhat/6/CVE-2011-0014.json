    "Title": "RHSA-2011:0677: openssl security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nA buffer over-read flaw was discovered in the way OpenSSL parsed the\nCertificate Status Request TLS extensions in ClientHello TLS handshake\nmessages. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to crash an SSL\nserver using the affected OpenSSL functionality. (CVE-2011-0014)\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The \"openssl speed\" command (which provides algorithm speed measurement)\nfailed when openssl was running in FIPS (Federal Information Processing\nStandards) mode, even if testing of FIPS approved algorithms was requested.\nFIPS mode disables ciphers and cryptographic hash algorithms that are not\napproved by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)\nstandards. With this update, the \"openssl speed\" command no longer fails.\n(BZ#619762)\n\n* The \"openssl pkcs12 -export\" command failed to export a PKCS#12 file in\nFIPS mode. The default algorithm for encrypting a certificate in the\nPKCS#12 file was not FIPS approved and thus did not work. The command now\nuses a FIPS approved algorithm by default in FIPS mode. (BZ#673453)\n\nThis update also adds the following enhancements:\n\n* The \"openssl s_server\" command, which previously accepted connections\nonly over IPv4, now accepts connections over IPv6. (BZ#601612)\n\n* For the purpose of allowing certain maintenance commands to be run (such\nas \"rsync\"), an \"OPENSSL_FIPS_NON_APPROVED_MD5_ALLOW\" environment variable\nhas been added. When a system is configured for FIPS mode and is in a\nmaintenance state, this newly added environment variable can be set to\nallow software that requires the use of an MD5 cryptographic hash algorithm\nto be run, even though the hash algorithm is not approved by the FIPS-140-2\nstandard. (BZ#673071)\n\nUsers of OpenSSL are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues and add these\nenhancements. For the update to take effect, all services linked to the\nOpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.",
