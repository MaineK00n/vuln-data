    "Title": "RHSA-2015:1347: pki-core security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to\nmanage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments. PKI Core\ncontains fundamental packages required by Red Hat Certificate System, which\ncomprise the Certificate Authority (CA) subsystem.\n\nMultiple cross-site scripting flaws were discovered in the Red Hat\nCertificate System Agent and End Entity pages. An attacker could use these\nflaws to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims using\nthe Certificate System's web interface. (CVE-2012-2662)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, pki-core required the SSL version 3 (SSLv3) protocol ranges\nto communicate with the 389-ds-base packages. However, recent changes to\n389-ds-base disabled the default use of SSLv3 and enforced using protocol\nranges supported by secure protocols, such as the TLS protocol. As a\nconsequence, the CA failed to install during an Identity Management (IdM)\nserver installation. This update adds TLS-related parameters to the\nserver.xml file of the CA to fix this problem, and running the\nipa-server-install command now installs the CA as expected. (BZ#1171848)\n\n* Previously, the ipa-server-install script failed when attempting to\nconfigure a stand-alone CA on systems with OpenJDK version 1.8.0 installed.\nThe pki-core build and runtime dependencies have been modified to use\nOpenJDK version 1.7.0 during the stand-alone CA configuration. As a result,\nipa-server-install no longer fails in this situation. (BZ#1212557)\n\n* Creating a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 replica from a Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 6 replica running the CA service sometimes failed in IdM deployments\nwhere the initial Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 CA master had been removed.\nThis could cause problems in some situations, such as when migrating from\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The bug occurred\ndue to a problem in a previous version of IdM where the subsystem user,\ncreated during the initial CA server installation, was removed together\nwith the initial master. This update adds the restore-subsystem-user.py\nscript that restores the subsystem user in the described situation, thus\nenabling administrators to create a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 replica in\nthis scenario. (BZ#1225589)\n\n* Several Java import statements specify wildcard arguments. However, due\nto the use of wildcard arguments in the import statements of the source\ncode contained in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 maintenance branch, a name\nspace collision created the potential for an incorrect class to be\nutilized. As a consequence, the Token Processing System (TPS) rebuild test\nfailed with an error message. This update addresses the bug by supplying\nthe fully named class in all of the affected areas, and the TPS rebuild\ntest no longer fails. (BZ#1144188)\n\n* Previously, pki-core failed to build with the rebased version of the\nCMake build system during the TPS rebuild test. The pki-core build files\nhave been updated to comply with the rebased version of CMake. As a result,\npki-core builds successfully in the described scenario. (BZ#1144608)\n\nUsers of pki-core are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
