    "Title": "RHSA-2012:1234: qemu-kvm security update (Important)",
    "Description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. qemu-kvm is the user-space\ncomponent for running virtual machines using KVM.\n\nA flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences\nwhen emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to\nwrite to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual\nconsole back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the\nhost or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)\n\nThis flaw did not affect the default use of KVM. Affected configurations\nwere:\n\n* When guests were started from the command line (\"/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm\")\nwithout the \"-nodefaults\" option, and also without specifying a\nserial or parallel device, or a virtio-console device, that specifically\ndoes not use a virtual console (vc) back-end. (Note that Red Hat does not\nsupport invoking \"qemu-kvm\" from the command line without \"-nodefaults\" on\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6.)\n\n* Guests that were managed via libvirt, such as when using Virtual Machine\nManager (virt-manager), but that have a serial or parallel device, or a\nvirtio-console device, that uses a virtual console back-end. By default,\nguests managed via libvirt will not use a virtual console back-end\nfor such devices.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.\n\nAll users of qemu-kvm should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve this issue. After installing this update, shut down all running\nvirtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them\nagain for this update to take effect.",
