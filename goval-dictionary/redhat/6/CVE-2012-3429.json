    "Title": "RHSA-2012:1139: bind-dyndb-ldap security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The dynamic LDAP back end is a plug-in for BIND that provides back-end\ncapabilities to LDAP databases. It features support for dynamic updates and\ninternal caching that help to reduce the load on LDAP servers.\n\nA flaw was found in the way bind-dyndb-ldap performed the escaping of names\nfrom DNS requests for use in LDAP queries. A remote attacker able to send\nDNS queries to a named server that is configured to use bind-dyndb-ldap\ncould use this flaw to cause named to exit unexpectedly with an assertion\nfailure. (CVE-2012-3429)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Sigbjorn Lie of Atea Norway for reporting this\nissue.\n\nAll bind-dyndb-ldap users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take\neffect, the named service must be restarted.",
