    "Description": "Mailman is a program used to help manage email discussion lists.\n\nMultiple input sanitization flaws were found in the way Mailman displayed\nusernames of subscribed users on certain pages. If a user who is subscribed\nto a mailing list were able to trick a victim into visiting one of those\npages, they could perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the\nvictim. (CVE-2011-0707)\n\nMultiple input sanitization flaws were found in the way Mailman displayed\nmailing list information. A mailing list administrator could use this flaw\nto conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims viewing a\nlist's \"listinfo\" page. (CVE-2010-3089)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Mark Sapiro for reporting these issues.\n\nUsers of mailman should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues.",
