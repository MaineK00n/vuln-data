    "Description": "Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,\nsupporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Squid processed certain HTTPS\nrequests when the SSL Bump feature was enabled. A remote attacker could\nsend specially crafted requests that could cause Squid to crash.\n(CVE-2014-0128)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Squid project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Mathias Fischer and Fabian Hugelshofer from Open\nSystems AG as the original reporters.\n\nAll squid users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this\nupdate, the squid service will be restarted automatically.",
