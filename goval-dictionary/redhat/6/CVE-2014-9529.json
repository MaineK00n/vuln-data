    "Title": "RHSA-2015:0864: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A flaw was found in the way seunshare, a utility for running executables\nunder a different security context, used the capng_lock functionality of\nthe libcap-ng library. The subsequent invocation of suid root binaries that\nrelied on the fact that the setuid() system call, among others, also sets\nthe saved set-user-ID when dropping the binaries' process privileges, could\nallow a local, unprivileged user to potentially escalate their privileges\non the system. Note: the fix for this issue is the kernel part of the\noverall fix, and introduces the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS functionality and the\nrelated SELinux exec transitions support. (CVE-2014-3215, Important)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP\nimplementation handled authentication key reference counting during INIT\ncollisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,\npotentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1421,\nImportant)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM implementation did not ensure\nthat the host CR4 control register value remained unchanged across VM\nentries on the same virtual CPU. A local, unprivileged user could use this\nflaw to cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2014-3690, Moderate)\n\n* An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the syscall tracing\nfunctionality of the Linux kernel's perf subsystem. A local, unprivileged\nuser could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-7825, Moderate)\n\n* An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the syscall tracing\nfunctionality of the Linux kernel's ftrace subsystem. On a system with\nftrace syscall tracing enabled, a local, unprivileged user could use this\nflaw to crash the system, or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-7826,\nModerate)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel memory resource controller's (memcg)\nhandling of OOM (out of memory) conditions could lead to deadlocks.\nAn attacker able to continuously spawn new processes within a single\nmemory-constrained cgroup during an OOM event could use this flaw to lock\nup the system. (CVE-2014-8171, Moderate)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel keys\nmanagement subsystem performed key garbage collection. A local attacker\ncould attempt accessing a key while it was being garbage collected, which\nwould cause the system to crash. (CVE-2014-9529, Moderate)\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the TechnoTrend/Hauppauge\nDEC USB device driver. A local user with write access to the corresponding\ndevice could use this flaw to crash the kernel or, potentially, elevate\ntheir privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8884, Low)\n\n* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ISO9660\nfile system implementation accessed data on an ISO9660 image with RockRidge\nExtension Reference (ER) records. An attacker with physical access to the\nsystem could use this flaw to disclose up to 255 bytes of kernel memory.\n(CVE-2014-9584, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Andy Lutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-3215\nand CVE-2014-3690, Robert Święcki for reporting CVE-2014-7825 and\nCVE-2014-7826, and Carl Henrik Lunde for reporting CVE-2014-9584. The\nCVE-2015-1421 issue was discovered by Sun Baoliang of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes is\navailable from the Technical Notes document linked to in the References\nsection.\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
