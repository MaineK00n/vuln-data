    "Title": "RHSA-2013:1620: xorg-x11-server security and bug fix update (Low)",
    "Description": "X.Org is an open source implementation of the X Window System. It provides\nthe basic low-level functionality that full-fledged graphical user\ninterfaces are designed upon.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the X.org X11 server registered new hot plugged\ndevices. If a local user switched to a different session and plugged in a\nnew device, input from that device could become available in the previous\nsession, possibly leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2013-1940)\n\nThis issue was found by David Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* A previous upstream patch modified the Xephyr X server to be resizeable,\nhowever, it did not enable the resize functionality by default. As a\nconsequence, X sandboxes were not resizeable on Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n6.4 and later. This update enables the resize functionality by default so\nthat X sandboxes can now be resized as expected. (BZ#915202)\n\n* In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the X Security extension (XC-SECURITY)\nhas been disabled and replaced by X Access Control Extension (XACE).\nHowever, XACE does not yet include functionality that was previously\navailable in XC-SECURITY. With this update, XC-SECURITY is enabled in the\nxorg-x11-server spec file on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. (BZ#957298)\n\n* Upstream code changes to extension initialization accidentally disabled\nthe GLX extension in Xvfb (the X virtual frame buffer), rendering headless\n3D applications not functional. An upstream patch to this problem has been\nbackported so the GLX extension is enabled again, and applications relying\non this extension work as expected. (BZ#969538)\n\nAll xorg-x11-server users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues.",
