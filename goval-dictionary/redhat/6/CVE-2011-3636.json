    "Title": "RHSA-2011:1533: ipa security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Red Hat Identity Management is a centralized authentication, identity\nmanagement and authorization solution for both traditional and cloud based\nenterprise environments. It integrates components of the Red Hat Directory\nServer, MIT Kerberos, Red Hat Certificate System, NTP and DNS. It provides\nweb browser and command-line interfaces. Its administration tools allow an\nadministrator to quickly install, set up, and administer a group of domain\ncontrollers to meet the authentication and identity management requirements\nof large scale Linux and UNIX deployments.\n\nA Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in Red Hat Identity\nManagement. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into\nthe management web interface, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, the\nattacker could perform Red Hat Identity Management configuration changes\nwith the privileges of the logged in user. (CVE-2011-3636)\n\nDue to the changes required to fix CVE-2011-3636, client tools will need to\nbe updated for client systems to communicate with updated Red Hat Identity\nManagement servers. New client systems will need to have the updated\nipa-client package installed to be enrolled. Already enrolled client\nsystems will need to have the updated certmonger package installed to be\nable to renew their system certificate. Note that system certificates are\nvalid for two years by default.\n\nUpdated ipa-client and certmonger packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6\nwere released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2. Future updates will\nprovide updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update includes several bug fixes. Space precludes documenting all of\nthese changes in this advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 6.2 Technical Notes for information on the most\nsignificant of these changes, linked to in the References section.\n\nUsers of Red Hat Identity Management should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.",
