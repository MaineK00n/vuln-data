    "Title": "RHSA-2016:0778: icedtea-web security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The IcedTea-Web project provides a Java web browser plug-in and an implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the Netx project. It also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the plug-in and Web Start implementations. IcedTea-Web now also contains PolicyEditor - a simple tool to configure Java policies.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: icedtea-web (1.6.2). (BZ#1275523)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that IcedTea-Web did not properly sanitize applet URLs when storing applet trust settings. A malicious web page could use this flaw to inject trust-settings configuration, and cause applets to be executed without user approval. (CVE-2015-5234)\n\n* It was discovered that IcedTea-Web did not properly determine an applet's origin when asking the user if the applet should be run. A malicious page could use this flaw to cause IcedTea-Web to execute the applet without user approval, or confuse the user into approving applet execution based on an incorrectly indicated applet origin. (CVE-2015-5235)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Andrea Palazzo (Truel IT) for reporting these issues.\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 Release Notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 Technical Notes linked from the References section.",
