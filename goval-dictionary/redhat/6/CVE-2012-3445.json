    "Title": "RHSA-2012:1202: libvirt security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the\nvirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In\naddition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized\nsystems.\n\nA flaw was found in libvirtd's RPC call handling. An attacker able to\nestablish a read-only connection to libvirtd could trigger this flaw with a\nspecially-crafted RPC command that has the number of parameters set to 0,\ncausing libvirtd to access invalid memory and crash. (CVE-2012-3445)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, repeatedly migrating a guest between two machines while using\nthe tunnelled migration could cause the libvirt daemon to lock up\nunexpectedly. The bug in the code for locking remote drivers has been fixed\nand repeated tunnelled migrations of domains now work as expected.\n(BZ#847946)\n\n* Previously, when certain system locales were used by the system, libvirt\ncould issue incorrect commands to the hypervisor. This bug has been fixed\nand the libvirt library and daemon are no longer affected by the choice of\nthe user locale. (BZ#847959)\n\nAll users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing\nthe updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.",
