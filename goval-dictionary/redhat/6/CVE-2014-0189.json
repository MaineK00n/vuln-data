    "Title": "RHBA-2014:1513: virt-who bug fix and enhancement update ()",
    "Description": "The virt-who package provides an agent that collects information about virtual\nguests present in the system and reports them to the Red Hat Subscription\nManager tool.\n\nThe virt-who package has been upgraded to upstream version 0.10, which provides\na number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. This update\nincludes support for multiple vCenter servers, fixed querying by cluster in\nlarge ESX environments, corrected communication with Red Hat Satellite server\nwhen ESXi has no host, fixed unregistering from Subscription Asset Manager (SAM)\nserver, fixed bug in Virtual Desktop and Server Management (VDSM) mode, support\nfor encrypted credentials, and fixed error when creating new VMs. (BZ#1002640,\nBZ#994575, BZ#1002447, BZ#1009230, BZ#1011877, BZ#1017056, BZ#1081286,\nBZ#1082416)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the virt-who daemon did not report guest attributes to the server,\nwhich disabled the virt_guest_limit feature. With this update, virt-who has been\nmodified to correctly report guest attributes. As a result, virt_guest_limit is\nnow supported by virt-who. (BZ#1098019)\n\n* Prior to this update, every call to Libvirtd.listDomains() function from the\n/usr/share/virt-who/virt/libvirtd/libvirtd.py script opened a new connection to\nthe libvirtd daemon but did not close it. Consequently, after several\niterations, virt-who consumed all connections allowed for any client of\nlibvirtd. With this update, Libvirtd.listDomains() has been modified to properly\nclose the livirtd connections, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1113938)\n\nUsers of virt-who are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which fixes\nthese bugs and add these enhancements.",
