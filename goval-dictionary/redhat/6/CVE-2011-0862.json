    "Description": "These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the\nOpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit.\n\nInteger overflow flaws were found in the way Java2D parsed JPEG images and\nuser-supplied fonts. An attacker could use these flaws to execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running an untrusted applet or\napplication. (CVE-2011-0862)\n\nIt was found that the MediaTracker implementation created Component\ninstances with unnecessary access privileges. A remote attacker could use\nthis flaw to elevate their privileges by utilizing an untrusted applet or\napplication that uses Swing. (CVE-2011-0871)\n\nA flaw was found in the HotSpot component in OpenJDK. Certain bytecode\ninstructions confused the memory management within the Java Virtual Machine\n(JVM), resulting in an applet or application crashing. (CVE-2011-0864)\n\nAn information leak flaw was found in the NetworkInterface class. An\nuntrusted applet or application could use this flaw to access information\nabout available network interfaces that should only be available to\nprivileged code. (CVE-2011-0867)\n\nAn incorrect float-to-long conversion, leading to an overflow, was found\nin the way certain objects (such as images and text) were transformed in\nJava2D. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an untrusted applet\nor application that uses Java2D. (CVE-2011-0868)\n\nIt was found that untrusted applets and applications could misuse a SOAP\nconnection to incorrectly set global HTTP proxy settings instead of\nsetting them in a local scope. This flaw could be used to intercept HTTP\nrequests. (CVE-2011-0869)\n\nA flaw was found in the way signed objects were deserialized. If trusted\nand untrusted code were running in the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and\nboth were deserializing the same signed object, the untrusted code could\nmodify said object by using this flaw to bypass the validation checks on\nsigned objects. (CVE-2011-0865)\n\nAll users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java\nmust be restarted for the update to take effect.",
