    "Title": "RHSA-2011:1534: nfs-utils security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Low)",
    "Description": "The nfs-utils packages provide a daemon for the kernel Network File System\n(NFS) server, and related tools such as the mount.nfs, umount.nfs, and\nshowmount programs.\n\nA flaw was found in the way nfs-utils performed IP based authentication of\nmount requests. In configurations where a directory was exported to a group\nof systems using a DNS wildcard or NIS (Network Information Service)\nnetgroup, an attacker could possibly gain access to other directories\nexported to a specific host or subnet, bypassing intended access\nrestrictions. (CVE-2011-2500)\n\nIt was found that the mount.nfs tool did not handle certain errors\ncorrectly when updating the mtab (mounted file systems table) file. A local\nattacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file. (CVE-2011-1749)\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs and adds an enhancement. Documentation\nfor these bug fixes and the enhancement will be available shortly from the\nTechnical Notes document, linked to in the References section.\n\nUsers of nfs-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues and add this\nenhancement. After installing this update, the nfs service will be\nrestarted automatically.",
