    "Title": "RHSA-2015:1320: ppc64-diag security, bug fix and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The ppc64-diag packages provide diagnostic tools for Linux on the 64-bit\nPowerPC platforms. The platform diagnostics write events reported by the\nfirmware to the service log, provide automated responses to urgent events,\nand notify system administrators or connected service frameworks about the\nreported events.\n\nMultiple insecure temporary file use flaws were found in the way the\nppc64-diag utility created certain temporary files. A local attacker could\npossibly use either of these flaws to perform a symbolic link attack and\noverwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running\nppc64-diag, or obtain sensitive information from the temporary files.\n(CVE-2014-4038, CVE-2014-4039)\n\nThe ppc64-diag packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.6.7, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.\n(BZ#1148142)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the \"explain_syslog\" and \"syslog_to_svclog\" commands failed\nwith a \"No such file or directory\" error message. With this update, the\nppc64-diag package specifies the location of the message_catalog directory\ncorrectly, which prevents the described error from occurring. (BZ#1139655)\n\n* Prior to this update, the /var/lock/subsys/rtas_errd file was incorrectly\nlabeled for SELinux as \"system_u:object_r:var_lock_t:s0\". This update\ncorrects the SELinux label to \"system_u:object_r:rtas_errd_var_lock_t:s0\".\n(BZ#1131501)\n\nUsers of ppc64-diag are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add these enhancements.",
