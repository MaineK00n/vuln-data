    "Title": "RHSA-2011:1465: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* IPv6 fragment identification value generation could allow a remote\nattacker to disrupt a target system's networking, preventing legitimate\nusers from accessing its services. (CVE-2011-2699, Important)\n\n* A signedness issue was found in the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet\nFile System) implementation. A malicious CIFS server could send a\nspecially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in\na denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS\nshare mounted. (CVE-2011-3191, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled fragmented IPv6 UDP\ndatagrams over the bridge with UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)\nfunctionality on. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2011-4326, Important)\n\n* The way IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs were\ngenerated could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and\npossibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs are\nnow more random. (CVE-2011-3188, Moderate)\n\n* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem\nin Userspace) implementation. A local user in the fuse group who has access\nto mount a FUSE file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2011-3353, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the b43 driver in the Linux kernel. If a system had\nan active wireless interface that uses the b43 driver, an attacker able to\nsend a specially-crafted frame to that interface could cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2011-3359, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way CIFS shares with DFS referrals at their root\nwere handled. An attacker on the local network who is able to deploy a\nmalicious CIFS server could create a CIFS network share that, when mounted,\nwould cause the client system to crash. (CVE-2011-3363, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled VLAN 0 frames with\nthe priority tag set. When using certain network drivers, an attacker on\nthe local network could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2011-3593, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw in the way memory containing security-related data was handled in\ntpm_read() could allow a local, unprivileged user to read the results of a\npreviously run TPM command. (CVE-2011-1162, Low)\n\n* A heap overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's EFI GUID Partition\nTable (GPT) implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause\na denial of service by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted\npartition tables. (CVE-2011-1577, Low)\n\n* The I/O statistics from the taskstats subsystem could be read without\nany restrictions. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to gather\nconfidential information, such as the length of a password used in a\nprocess. (CVE-2011-2494, Low)\n\n* It was found that the perf tool, a part of the Linux kernel's Performance\nEvents implementation, could load its configuration file from the current\nworking directory. If a local user with access to the perf tool were\ntricked into running perf in a directory that contains a specially-crafted\nconfiguration file, it could cause perf to overwrite arbitrary files and\ndirectories accessible to that user. (CVE-2011-2905, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Fernando Gont for reporting CVE-2011-2699;\nDarren Lavender for reporting CVE-2011-3191; Dan Kaminsky for reporting\nCVE-2011-3188; Yogesh Sharma for reporting CVE-2011-3363; Gideon Naim for\nreporting CVE-2011-3593; Peter Huewe for reporting CVE-2011-1162; Timo\nWarns for reporting CVE-2011-1577; and Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for\nreporting CVE-2011-2494.\n\nThis update also fixes various bugs. Documentation for these changes will\nbe available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the\nReferences section.",
