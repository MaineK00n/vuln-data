    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0058: glibc security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple\nprograms on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the\nstandard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot\nfunction properly.\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the way the glibc library read timezone files. If a\ncarefully-crafted timezone file was loaded by an application linked against\nglibc, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n(CVE-2009-5029)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the remote procedure call (RPC)\nimplementation in glibc. A remote attacker able to open a large number of\nconnections to an RPC service that is using the RPC implementation from\nglibc, could use this flaw to make that service use an excessive amount of\nCPU time. (CVE-2011-4609)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* glibc had incorrect information for numeric separators and groupings for\nspecific French, Spanish, and German locales. Therefore, applications\nutilizing glibc's locale support printed numbers with the wrong separators\nand groupings when those locales were in use. With this update, the\nseparator and grouping information has been fixed. (BZ#754116)\n\n* The RHBA-2011:1179 glibc update introduced a regression, causing glibc to\nincorrectly parse groups with more than 126 members, resulting in\napplications such as \"id\" failing to list all the groups a particular user\nwas a member of. With this update, group parsing has been fixed.\n(BZ#766484)\n\n* glibc incorrectly allocated too much memory due to a race condition\nwithin its own malloc routines. This could cause a multi-threaded\napplication to allocate more memory than was expected. With this update,\nthe race condition has been fixed, and malloc's behavior is now consistent\nwith the documentation regarding the MALLOC_ARENA_TEST and MALLOC_ARENA_MAX\nenvironment variables. (BZ#769594)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to resolve these issues.",
