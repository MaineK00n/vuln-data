    "Title": "RHSA-2016:0152: sos security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The sos package contains a set of tools that gather information from system\nhardware, logs and configuration files. The information can then be used\nfor diagnostic purposes and debugging.\n\nAn insecure temporary file use flaw was found in the way sos created \ncertain sosreport files. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw \nto perform a symbolic link attack to reveal the contents of sosreport \nfiles, or in some cases modify arbitrary files and escalate their \nprivileges on the system. (CVE-2015-7529)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, when the hpasm plug-in ran the \"hpasmcli\" command in a Python\nPopen constructor or a system pipeline, the command would hang and\neventually time out after 300 seconds. Sos was forced to wait for the time\nout to finish, unnecessarily prolonging its run time. With this update, the\ntimeout of the \"hpasmcli\" command has been set to 0, eliminating the delay\nand speeding up sos completion time. (BZ#1291828)\n\nAll sos users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
