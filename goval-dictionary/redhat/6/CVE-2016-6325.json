    "Title": "RHSA-2016:2045: tomcat6 security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed certain configuration files read by the Tomcat initialization script as writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-6325)\n\n* It was found that several Tomcat session persistence mechanisms could allow a remote, authenticated user to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a web application that placed a crafted object in a session. (CVE-2016-0714)\n\n* It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5388)\n\n* A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's RequestUtil.java. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory via a '/..' in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call, as demonstrated by the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps directory. (CVE-2015-5174)\n\n* It was found that Tomcat could reveal the presence of a directory even when that directory was protected by a security constraint. A user could make a request to a directory via a URL not ending with a slash and, depending on whether Tomcat redirected that request, could confirm whether that directory existed. (CVE-2015-5345)\n\n* It was found that Tomcat allowed the StatusManagerServlet to be loaded by a web application when a security manager was configured. This allowed a web application to list all deployed web applications and expose sensitive information such as session IDs. (CVE-2016-0706)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting CVE-2016-5388. The CVE-2016-6325 issue was discovered by Red Hat Product Security.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Due to a bug in the tomcat6 spec file, the catalina.out file's md5sum, size, and mtime attributes were compared to the file's attributes at installation time. Because these attributes change after the service is started, the \"rpm -V\" command previously failed. With this update, the attributes mentioned above are ignored in the RPM verification and the catalina.out file now passes the verification check. (BZ#1357123)",
