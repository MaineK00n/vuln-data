    "Title": "RHSA-2015:1460: wireshark security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol analyzer,\nwhich is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer\nnetwork.\n\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could\ncrash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or\nopened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2014-8714, CVE-2014-8712, CVE-2014-8713,\nCVE-2014-8711, CVE-2014-8710, CVE-2015-0562, CVE-2015-0564, CVE-2015-2189,\nCVE-2015-2191)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the Wireshark tool did not support Advanced Encryption\nStandard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) cryptographic algorithm. As a\nconsequence, AES-GCM was not decrypted. Support for AES-GCM has been added\nto Wireshark, and AES-GCM is now correctly decrypted. (BZ#1095065)\n\n* Previously, when installing the system using the kickstart method, a\ndependency on the shadow-utils packages was missing from the wireshark\npackages, which could cause the installation to fail with a \"bad scriptlet\"\nerror message. With this update, shadow-utils are listed as required in the\nwireshark packages spec file, and kickstart installation no longer fails.\n(BZ#1121275)\n\n* Prior to this update, the Wireshark tool could not decode types of\nelliptic curves in Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Client Hello.\nConsequently, Wireshark incorrectly displayed elliptic curves types as\ndata. A patch has been applied to address this bug, and Wireshark now\ndecodes elliptic curves types properly. (BZ#1131203)\n\n* Previously, a dependency on the gtk2 packages was missing from the\nwireshark packages. As a consequence, the Wireshark tool failed to start\nunder certain circumstances due to an unresolved symbol,\n\"gtk_combo_box_text_new_with_entry\", which was added in gtk version 2.24.\nWith this update, a dependency on gtk2 has been added, and Wireshark now\nalways starts as expected. (BZ#1160388)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* With this update, the Wireshark tool supports process substitution, which\nfeeds the output of a process (or processes) into the standard input of\nanother process using the \"\u003c(command_list)\" syntax. When using process\nsubstitution with large files as input, Wireshark failed to decode such\ninput. (BZ#1104210)\n\n* Wireshark has been enhanced to enable capturing packets with nanosecond\ntime stamp precision, which allows better analysis of recorded network\ntraffic. (BZ#1146578)\n\nAll wireshark users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add these\nenhancements. All running instances of Wireshark must be restarted for the\nupdate to take effect.",
