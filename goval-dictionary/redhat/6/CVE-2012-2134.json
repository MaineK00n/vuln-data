    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0683: bind-dyndb-ldap security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The dynamic LDAP back end is a plug-in for BIND that provides back-end\ncapabilities to LDAP databases. It features support for dynamic updates\nand internal caching that help to reduce the load on LDAP servers.\n\nA flaw was found in the way bind-dyndb-ldap handled LDAP query errors. If a\nremote attacker were able to send DNS queries to a named server that is\nconfigured to use bind-dyndb-ldap, they could trigger such an error with a\nDNS query leveraging bind-dyndb-ldap's insufficient escaping of the LDAP\nbase DN (distinguished name). This would result in an invalid LDAP query\nthat named would retry in a loop, preventing it from responding to other\nDNS queries. With this update, bind-dyndb-ldap only attempts to retry one\ntime when an LDAP search returns an unexpected error. (CVE-2012-2134)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ronald van Zantvoort for reporting this issue.\n\nAll bind-dyndb-ldap users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take\neffect, the named service must be restarted.",
