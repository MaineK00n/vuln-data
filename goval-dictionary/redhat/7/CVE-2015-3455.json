    "Title": "RHSA-2015:2378: squid security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,\nsupporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.\n\nIt was found that Squid configured with client-first SSL-bump did not\ncorrectly validate X.509 server certificate host name fields. A\nman-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof a Squid server\nusing a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2015-3455)\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the squid process did not handle file descriptors correctly\nwhen receiving Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. As a\nconsequence, the process gradually accumulated open file descriptors. This\nbug has been fixed and squid now handles SNMP requests correctly, closing\nfile descriptors when necessary. (BZ#1198778)\n\n* Under high system load, the squid process sometimes terminated\nunexpectedly with a segmentation fault during reboot. This update provides\nbetter memory handling during reboot, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1225640)\n\nUsers of squid are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix\nthese bugs. After installing this update, the squid service will be\nrestarted automatically.",
