    "Title": "RHSA-2016:2600: squid security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: squid (3.5.20). (BZ#1273942, BZ#1349775)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Incorrect boundary checks were found in the way squid handled headers in HTTP responses, which could lead to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP response. (CVE-2016-2569, CVE-2016-2570)\n\n* It was found that squid did not properly handle errors when failing to parse an HTTP response, possibly leading to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP response. (CVE-2016-2571, CVE-2016-2572)\n\n* An incorrect boundary check was found in the way squid handled the Vary header in HTTP responses, which could lead to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP response. (CVE-2016-3948)\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
