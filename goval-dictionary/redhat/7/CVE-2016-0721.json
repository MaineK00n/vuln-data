    "Title": "RHSA-2016:2596: pcs security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The pcs packages provide a command-line configuration system for the Pacemaker and Corosync utilities.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: pcs (0.9.152). (BZ#1299847)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in the pcsd web UI. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web page that, when visited by a user with a valid pcsd session, would allow the attacker to trigger requests on behalf of the user, for example removing resources or restarting/removing nodes. (CVE-2016-0720)\n\n* It was found that pcsd did not invalidate cookies on the server side when a user logged out. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform session fixation attacks on pcsd. (CVE-2016-0721)\n\nThese issues were discovered by Martin Prpic (Red Hat Product Security).\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
