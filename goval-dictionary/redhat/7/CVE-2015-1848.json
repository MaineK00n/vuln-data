    "Title": "RHSA-2015:0980: pcs security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The pcs packages provide a command-line tool and a web UI to configure and\nmanage the Pacemaker and Corosync tools.\n\nIt was found that the pcs daemon did not sign cookies containing session\ndata that were sent to clients connecting via the pcsd web UI. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to forge cookies and bypass authorization\nchecks, possibly gaining elevated privileges in the pcsd web UI.\n(CVE-2015-1848)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Tomas Jelinek of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, the Corosync tool allowed the two_node option and the\nauto_tie_breaker option to exist in the corosync.conf file at the same\ntime. As a consequence, if both options were included, auto_tie_breaker was\nsilently ignored and the two_node fence race decided which node would\nsurvive in the event of a communication break. With this update, the pcs\ndaemon has been fixed so that it does not produce corosync.conf files with\nboth two_node and auto_tie_breaker included. In addition, if both two_node\nand auto_tie_breaker are detected in corosync.conf, Corosync issues a\nmessage at start-up and disables two_node mode. As a result,\nauto_tie_breaker effectively overrides two_node mode if both options are\nspecified. (BZ#1205848)\n\nAll pcs users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdated packages, the pcsd daemon will be restarted automatically.",
