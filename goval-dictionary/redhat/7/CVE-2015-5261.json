    "Description": "The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a\nremote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a\nvirtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with\nnetwork access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for\nviewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine\n(KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way SPICE handled\ncertain guest QXL commands related to surface creation. A user in a guest\ncould use this flaw to read and write arbitrary memory locations on the\nhost. (CVE-2015-5261)\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way spice handled\ncertain QXL commands related to the \"surface_id\" parameter. A user in a\nguest could use this flaw to crash the host QEMU-KVM process or, possibly,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process.\n(CVE-2015-5260)\n\nThese issues were discovered by Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat.\n\nAll spice users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
