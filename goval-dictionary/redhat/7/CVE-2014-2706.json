    "Title": "RHSA-2014:1023: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that Linux kernel's ptrace subsystem did not properly\nsanitize the address-space-control bits when the program-status word (PSW)\nwas being set. On IBM S/390 systems, a local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to set address-space-control bits to the kernel space, and thus\ngain read and write access to kernel memory. (CVE-2014-3534, Important)\n\n* It was found that the permission checks performed by the Linux kernel\nwhen a netlink message was received were not sufficient. A local,\nunprivileged user could potentially bypass these restrictions by passing a\nnetlink socket as stdout or stderr to a more privileged process and\naltering the output of this process. (CVE-2014-0181, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that a remote attacker could use a race condition flaw in\nthe ath_tx_aggr_sleep() function to crash the system by creating large\nnetwork traffic on the system's Atheros 9k wireless network adapter.\n(CVE-2014-2672, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel performed forking inside of\na transaction. A local, unprivileged user on a PowerPC system that supports\ntransactional memory could use this flaw to crash the system.\n(CVE-2014-2673, Moderate)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mac80211\nsubsystem implementation handled synchronization between TX and STA wake-up\ncode paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.\n(CVE-2014-2706, Moderate)\n\n* An integer underflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream\nControl Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation processed certain\nCOOKIE_ECHO packets. By sending a specially crafted SCTP packet, a remote\nattacker could use this flaw to prevent legitimate connections to a\nparticular SCTP server socket to be made. (CVE-2014-4667, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Martin Schwidefsky of IBM for reporting\nCVE-2014-3534, Andy Lutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-0181, and Gopal Reddy\nKodudula of Nokia Siemens Networks for reporting CVE-2014-4667.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Due to a NULL pointer dereference bug in the IPIP and SIT tunneling code,\na kernel panic could be triggered when using IPIP or SIT tunnels with\nIPsec. This update restructures the related code to avoid a NULL pointer\ndereference and the kernel no longer panics when using IPIP or SIT tunnels\nwith IPsec. (BZ#1114957)\n\n* Previously, an IBM POWER8 system could terminate unexpectedly when the\nkernel received an IRQ while handling a transactional memory re-checkpoint\ncritical section. This update ensures that IRQs are disabled in this\nsituation and the problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1113150)\n\n* A missing read memory barrier, rmb(), in the bnx2x driver caused the\nkernel to crash under various circumstances. This problem has been fixed\nby adding an rmb() call to the relevant place in the bnx2x code.\n(BZ#1107721)\n\n* The hpwdt driver previously emitted a panic message that was misleading\non certain HP systems. This update ensures that upon a kernel panic, hpwdt\ndisplays information valid on all HP systems. (BZ#1096961)\n\n* The qla2xxx driver has been upgraded to version 8.06.00.08.07.0-k3,\nwhich provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version in order to\ncorrect various timeout problems with the mailbox commands. (BZ#1112389)\n\n* The SCSI mid-layer could retry an I/O operation indefinitely if a storage\narray repeatedly returned a CHECK CONDITION status to that I/O operation\nbut the sense data was invalid. This update fixes the problem by limiting\na time for which is such an I/O operation retried. (BZ#1114468)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
