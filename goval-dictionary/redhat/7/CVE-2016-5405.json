    "Title": "RHSA-2016:2594: 389-ds-base security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "389 Directory Server is an LDAP version 3 (LDAPv3) compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server administration.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: 389-ds-base (1.3.5.10). (BZ#1270020)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was found that 389 Directory Server was vulnerable to a flaw in which the default ACI (Access Control Instructions) could be read by an anonymous user. This could lead to leakage of sensitive information. (CVE-2016-5416)\n\n* An information disclosure flaw was found in 389 Directory Server. A user with no access to objects in certain LDAP sub-tree could send LDAP ADD operations with a specific object name. The error message returned to the user was different based on whether the target object existed or not. (CVE-2016-4992)\n\n* It was found that 389 Directory Server was vulnerable to a remote password disclosure via timing attack. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve directory server password after many tries. (CVE-2016-5405)\n\nThe CVE-2016-5416 issue was discovered by Viktor Ashirov (Red Hat); the CVE-2016-4992 issue was discovered by Petr Spacek (Red Hat) and Martin Basti (Red Hat); and the CVE-2016-5405 issue was discovered by William Brown (Red Hat).\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
