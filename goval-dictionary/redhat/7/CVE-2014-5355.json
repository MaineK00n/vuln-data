    "Title": "RHSA-2015:2154: krb5 security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Kerberos is a network authentication system, which can improve the security\nof your network by eliminating the insecure practice of sending passwords\nover the network in unencrypted form. It allows clients and servers to\nauthenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third party, the\nKerberos key distribution center (KDC).\n\nIt was found that the krb5_read_message() function of MIT Kerberos did not\ncorrectly sanitize input, and could create invalid krb5_data objects.\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash a Kerberos\nchild process via a specially crafted request. (CVE-2014-5355)\n\nA flaw was found in the OTP kdcpreauth module of MIT kerberos.\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the\nrequires_preauth flag on a client principal and obtain a ciphertext\nencrypted in the principal's long-term key. This ciphertext could be used\nto conduct an off-line dictionary attack against the user's password.\n(CVE-2015-2694)\n\nThe krb5 packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.13.2, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.\n(BZ#1203889)\n\nNotably, this update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the RADIUS support (libkrad) in krb5 was sending krb5\nauthentication for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) transports multiple\ntimes, accidentally using a code path intended to be used only for\nunreliable transport types, for example User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\ntransports. A patch that fixes the problem by disabling manual retries for\nreliable transports, such as TCP, has been applied, and the correct code\npath is now used in this situation. (BZ#1251586)\n\n* Attempts to use Kerberos single sign-on (SSO) to access SAP NetWeaver\nsystems sometimes failed. The SAP NetWeaver developer trace displayed the\nfollowing error message:\n\n    No credentials were supplied, or the credentials were\n    unavailable or inaccessible\n    Unable to establish the security context\n\nQuerying SSO credential lifetime has been modified to trigger credential\nacquisition, thus preventing the error from occurring. Now, the user can\nsuccessfully use Kerberos SSO for accessing SAP NetWeaver systems.\n(BZ#1252454)\n\nAll krb5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add these enhancements.",
