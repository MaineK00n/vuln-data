    "Title": "RHSA-2015:2079: binutils security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The binutils packages provide a set of binary utilities.\n\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the libbdf library used by\nvarious binutils utilities. If a user were tricked into processing a\nspecially crafted file with an application using the libbdf library, it\ncould cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2014-8485, CVE-2014-8501, CVE-2014-8502, CVE-2014-8503,\nCVE-2014-8504, CVE-2014-8738)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the libbdf library used by various\nbinutils utilities. If a user were tricked into processing a specially\ncrafted file with an application using the libbdf library, it could cause\nthe application to crash. (CVE-2014-8484)\n\nA directory traversal flaw was found in the strip and objcopy utilities.\nA specially crafted file could cause strip or objdump to overwrite an\narbitrary file writable by the user running either of these utilities.\n(CVE-2014-8737)\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Binary files started by the system loader could lack the Relocation\nRead-Only (RELRO) protection even though it was explicitly requested when\nthe application was built. This bug has been fixed on multiple\narchitectures. Applications and all dependent object files, archives, and\nlibraries built with an alpha or beta version of binutils should be rebuilt\nto correct this defect. (BZ#1200138, BZ#1175624)\n\n* The ld linker on 64-bit PowerPC now correctly checks the output format\nwhen asked to produce a binary in another format than PowerPC. (BZ#1226864)\n\n* An important variable that holds the symbol table for the binary being\ndebugged has been made persistent, and the objdump utility on 64-bit\nPowerPC is now able to access the needed information without reading an\ninvalid memory region. (BZ#1172766)\n\n* Undesirable runtime relocations described in RHBA-2015:0974. (BZ#872148)\n\nThe update adds these enhancements:\n\n* New hardware instructions of the IBM z Systems z13 are now supported by\nassembler, disassembler, and linker, as well as Single Instruction,\nMultiple Data (SIMD) instructions. (BZ#1182153)\n\n* Expressions of the form: \"FUNC@localentry\" to refer to the local entry\npoint for the FUNC function (if defined) are now supported by the PowerPC\nassembler. These are required by the ELFv2 ABI on the little-endian variant\nof IBM Power Systems. (BZ#1194164)\n\nAll binutils users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add these\nenhancements.",
