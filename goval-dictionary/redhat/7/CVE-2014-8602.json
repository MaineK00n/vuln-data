    "Title": "RHSA-2015:2455: unbound security and bug fix update (Low)",
    "Description": "The unbound packages provide a validating, recursive, and caching DNS or\nDNSSEC resolver.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in unbound that an attacker could use to\ntrick the unbound resolver into following an endless loop of delegations,\nconsuming an excessive amount of resources. (CVE-2014-8602)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, there was a mistake in the time configuration in\nthe cron job invoking unbound-anchor to update the root zone key.\nConsequently, unbound-anchor was invoked once a month instead of every day,\nthus not complying with RFC 5011. The cron job has been replaced with a\nsystemd timer unit that is invoked on a daily basis. Now, the root zone key\nvalidity is checked daily at a random time within a 24-hour window, and\ncompliance with RFC 5011 is ensured. (BZ#1180267)\n\n* Previously, the unbound packages were installing their configuration file\nfor the systemd-tmpfiles utility into the /etc/tmpfiles.d/ directory. As a \nconsequence, changes to unbound made by the administrator in \n/etc/tmpfiles.d/ could be overwritten on package reinstallation or update. \nTo fix this bug, unbound has been amended to install the configuration file\ninto the /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ directory. As a result, the system \nadministrator's configuration in /etc/tmpfiles.d/ is preserved, including \nany changes, on package reinstallation or update. (BZ#1180995)\n\n* The unbound server default configuration included validation of DNS\nrecords using the DNSSEC Look-aside Validation (DLV) registry. The Internet\nSystems Consortium (ISC) plans to deprecate the DLV registry service as no\nlonger needed, and unbound could execute unnecessary steps. Therefore, the \nuse of the DLV registry has been removed from the unbound server default \nconfiguration. Now, unbound does not try to perform DNS records validation \nusing the DLV registry. (BZ#1223339)\n\nAll unbound users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
