    "Title": "RHSA-2016:0185: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's keys subsystem did not correctly\ngarbage collect uninstantiated keyrings. A local attacker could use this\nflaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the\nsystem. (CVE-2015-7872, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled IRET faults during\nthe processing of NMIs. An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to\ncrash the system or, potentially (although highly unlikely), escalate their\nprivileges on the system. (CVE-2015-5157, Moderate)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, processing packets with a lot of different IPv6 source\naddresses caused the kernel to return warnings concerning soft-lockups due\nto high lock contention and latency increase. With this update, lock\ncontention is reduced by backing off concurrent waiting threads on the\nlock. As a result, the kernel no longer issues warnings in the described\nscenario. (BZ#1285370)\n\n* Prior to this update, block device readahead was artificially limited.\nAs a consequence, the read performance was poor, especially on RAID\ndevices. Now, per-device readahead limits are used for each device instead\nof a global limit. As a result, read performance has improved, especially\non RAID devices. (BZ#1287550)\n\n* After injecting an EEH error, the host was previously not recovering and\nobserving I/O hangs in HTX tool logs. This update makes sure that when one\nor both of EEH_STATE_MMIO_ACTIVE and EEH_STATE_MMIO_ENABLED flags is marked\nin the PE state, the PE's IO path is regarded as enabled as well. As a\nresult, the host no longer hangs and recovers as expected. (BZ#1289101)\n\n* The genwqe device driver was previously using the GFP_ATOMIC flag for\nallocating consecutive memory pages from the kernel's atomic memory pool,\neven in non-atomic situations. This could lead to allocation failures\nduring memory pressure. With this update, the genwqe driver's memory\nallocations use the GFP_KERNEL flag, and the driver can allocate memory\neven during memory pressure situations. (BZ#1289450)\n\n* The nx842 co-processor for IBM Power Systems could in some circumstances\nprovide invalid data due to a data corruption bug during uncompression.\nWith this update, all compression and uncompression calls to the nx842\nco-processor contain a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) flag, which forces all\ncompression and uncompression operations to check data integrity and\nprevents the co-processor from providing corrupted data. (BZ#1289451)\n\n* A failed \"updatepp\" operation on the little-endian variant of IBM Power\nSystems could previously cause a wrong hash value to be used for the next\nhash insert operation in the page table. This could result in a missing\nhash pte update or invalidate operation, potentially causing memory\ncorruption. With this update, the hash value is always recalculated after a\nfailed \"updatepp\" operation, avoiding memory corruption. (BZ#1289452)\n\n* Large Receive Offload (LRO) flag disabling was not being propagated\ndownwards from above devices in vlan and bond hierarchy, breaking the flow\nof traffic. This problem has been fixed and LRO flags now propagate\ncorrectly. (BZ#1292072)\n\n* Due to rounding errors in the CPU frequency of the intel_pstate driver,\nthe CPU frequency never reached the value requested by the user. A kernel\npatch has been applied to fix these rounding errors. (BZ#1296276)\n\n* When running several containers (up to 100), reports of hung tasks were\npreviously reported. This update fixes the AB-BA deadlock in the\ndm_destroy() function, and the hung reports no longer occur. (BZ#1296566)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",

An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to\ncrash the system or, potentially (although highly unlikely), escalate their\nprivileges on the system. (CVE-2015-5157, Moderate)\n\nThe kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to version 3.10.0-327.10.1, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements, including:\n\n* [md] dm: fix AB-BA deadlock in __dm_destroy() \n\n* [md] revert \"dm-mpath: fix stalls when handling invalid ioctl\n\n* [cpufreq] intel_pstate: Fix limits-\u003emax_perf and limits-\u003emax_policy_pct\nrounding errors\n\n* [cpufreq] revert \"intel_pstate: fix rounding error in max_freq_pct\"\n\n* [crypto] nx: 842 - Add CRC and validation support\n\n* [of] return NUMA_NO_NODE from fallback of_node_to_nid()\n\n(BZ#1282591)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Because the realtime kernel replaces most of the spinlocks with\nrtmutexes, the locking scheme used in both NAPI polling and busy polling\ncould become out of synchronization with the State Machine they protected.\nThis could cause system performance degradation or even a livelock\nsituation when a machine with faster NICs (10g or 40g) was subject to a\nheavy pressure receiving network packets. The locking schemes on NAPI\npolling and busy polling routines have been hardened to enforce the State\nmachine sanity to help ensure the system continues to function properly\nunder pressure. (BZ#1293230)\n\n* A possible livelock in the NAPI polling and busy polling routines could\nlead the system to a livelock on threads running at high, realtime,\npriorities. The threads running at priorities lower than the ones of the\nthreads involved in the livelock were prevented from running on the CPUs\naffected by the livelock. Among those lower priority threads are the rcuc/\nthreads. With this update, right before (4 jiffies) a RCU stall is\ndetected, the rcuc/ threads on the CPUs facing the livelock have their\npriorities boosted above the priority of the threads involved in the\nlivelock. The softirq code has also been updated to be more robust.\nThese modifications allow the rcuc/ threads to execute even under system\npressure, mitigating the RCU stalls. (BZ#1293229)\n\n* Multiple CPUs trying to take an rq lock previously caused large latencies\non machines with many CPUs. On systems with more than 32 cores, this update\nuses the \"push\" rather than \"pull\" approach and provides multiple changes\nto the scheduling of rq locks. As a result, machines no longer suffer from\nmultiplied latencies on large CPU systems. (BZ#1282597)\n\n* Previously, the SFC driver for 10 GB cards executed polling in NAPI mode,\nusing a locking mechanism similar to a \"trylock\". Consequently, when\nrunning on a Realtime kernel, a livelock could occur. This update modifies\nthe locking mechanism so that once the lock is taken it is not released\nuntil the operation is complete. (BZ#1282609)\n\nAll kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add these enhancements.
