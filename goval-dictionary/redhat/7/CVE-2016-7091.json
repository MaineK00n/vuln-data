    "Title": "RHSA-2016:2593: sudo security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Low)",
    "Description": "The sudo packages contain the sudo utility which allows system administrators to provide certain users with the permission to execute privileged commands, which are used for system management purposes, without having to log in as root.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that the default sudo configuration preserved the value of INPUTRC from the user's environment, which could lead to information disclosure. A local user with sudo access to a restricted program that uses readline could use this flaw to read content from specially formatted files with elevated privileges provided by sudo. (CVE-2016-7091)\n\nNote: With this update, INPUTRC was removed from the env_keep list in /etc/sudoers to avoid having sudo preserve the value of this variable when invoking privileged commands.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Grisha Levit for reporting this issue.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
