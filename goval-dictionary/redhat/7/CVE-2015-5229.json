    "Title": "RHSA-2016:0176: glibc security and bug fix update (Critical)",
    "Description": "The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX \nthread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the \nname service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the \nsystem. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function \ncorrectly.\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the libresolv library\nperformed dual A/AAAA DNS queries. A remote attacker could create a\nspecially crafted DNS response which could cause libresolv to crash or,\npotentially, execute code with the permissions of the user running the\nlibrary. Note: this issue is only exposed when libresolv is called from the\nnss_dns NSS service module. (CVE-2015-7547)\n\nIt was discovered that the calloc implementation in glibc could return\nmemory areas which contain non-zero bytes. This could result in unexpected\napplication behavior such as hangs or crashes. (CVE-2015-5229)\n\nThe CVE-2015-7547 issue was discovered by the Google Security Team and Red\nHat. Red Hat would like to thank Jeff Layton for reporting the\nCVE-2015-5229 issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The existing implementation of the \"free\" function causes all memory\npools beyond the first to return freed memory directly to the operating\nsystem as quickly as possible. This can result in performance degradation\nwhen the rate of free calls is very high. The first memory pool (the main\npool) does provide a method to rate limit the returns via M_TRIM_THRESHOLD,\nbut this method is not available to subsequent memory pools.\n\nWith this update, the M_TRIM_THRESHOLD method is extended to apply to all\nmemory pools, which improves performance for threads with very high amounts\nof free calls and limits the number of \"madvise\" system calls. The change\nalso increases the total transient memory usage by processes because the\ntrim threshold must be reached before memory can be freed.\n\nTo return to the previous behavior, you can either set M_TRIM_THRESHOLD\nusing the \"mallopt\" function, or set the MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD environment\nvariable to 0. (BZ#1298930)\n\n* On the little-endian variant of 64-bit IBM Power Systems (ppc64le), a bug\nin the dynamic loader could cause applications compiled with profiling\nenabled to fail to start with the error \"monstartup: out of memory\".\nThe bug has been corrected and applications compiled for profiling now\nstart correctly. (BZ#1298956)\n\nAll glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
