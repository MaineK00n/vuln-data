    "Title": "RHSA-2016:2575: curl security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was found that the libcurl library did not prevent TLS session resumption when the client certificate had changed. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate. (CVE-2016-5419)\n\n* It was found that the libcurl library did not check the client certificate when choosing the TLS connection to reuse. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate. (CVE-2016-5420)\n\n* It was found that the libcurl library using the NSS (Network Security Services) library as TLS/SSL backend incorrectly re-used client certificates for subsequent TLS connections in certain cases. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate. (CVE-2016-7141)\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
