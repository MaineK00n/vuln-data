    "Title": "RHSA-2015:1137: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read\nand write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were\nalready processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,\npotentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array\noverrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system\nor, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,\nImportant)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel keys\nmanagement subsystem performed key garbage collection. A local attacker\ncould attempt accessing a key while it was being garbage collected, which\nwould cause the system to crash. (CVE-2014-9529, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation\nimplementation handled forking or closing of a task with an 'int80' entry.\nA local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges\non the system. (CVE-2015-2830, Low)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's ISO file system implementation did\nnot correctly limit the traversal of Rock Ridge extension Continuation\nEntries (CE). An attacker with physical access to the system could use this\nflaw to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel, resulting in a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2014-9420, Low)\n\n* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ISO9660\nfile system implementation accessed data on an ISO9660 image with RockRidge\nExtension Reference (ER) records. An attacker with physical access to the\nsystem could use this flaw to disclose up to 255 bytes of kernel memory.\n(CVE-2014-9584, Low)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the nft_flush_table() function of the Linux\nkernel's netfilter tables implementation flushed rules that were\nreferencing deleted chains. A local user who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN\ncapability could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2015-1573, Low)\n\n* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel randomized\nthe stack for processes on certain 64-bit architecture systems, such as\nx86-64, causing the stack entropy to be reduced by four. (CVE-2015-1593,\nLow)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Carl Henrik Lunde for reporting CVE-2014-9420\nand CVE-2014-9584. The security impact of the CVE-2015-1805 issue was\ndiscovered by Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes is\navailable from the following Knowledgebase article:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/1469163\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
