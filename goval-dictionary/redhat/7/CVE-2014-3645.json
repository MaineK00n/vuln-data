    "Title": "RHSA-2014:1724: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM\nsubsystem handled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user\nwho has access to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.\n(CVE-2014-3611, Important)\n\n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's\nStream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled\nsimultaneous connections between the same hosts. A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-5077, Important)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem did not handle the VM\nexits gracefully for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT)\nand invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On hosts\nwith an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit support, an unprivileged\nguest user could use these instructions to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-3645,\nCVE-2014-3646, Moderate)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Advanced\nLinux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled user controls. A\nlocal, privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n(CVE-2014-4653, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Lars Bull of Google for reporting\nCVE-2014-3611, and the Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security for\nreporting CVE-2014-3645 and CVE-2014-3646.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* A known issue that could prevent Chelsio adapters using the cxgb4 driver\nfrom being initialized on IBM POWER8 systems has been fixed. These\nadapters can now be used on IBM POWER8 systems as expected. (BZ#1130548)\n\n* When bringing a hot-added CPU online, the kernel did not initialize a\nCPU mask properly, which could result in a kernel panic. This update\ncorrects the bug by ensuring that the CPU mask is properly initialized and\nthe correct NUMA node selected. (BZ#1134715)\n\n* The kernel could fail to bring a CPU online if the hardware supported\nboth, the acpi-cpufreq and intel_pstate modules. This update ensures that\nthe acpi-cpufreq module is not loaded in the intel_pstate module is\nloaded. (BZ#1134716)\n\n* Due to a bug in the time accounting of the kernel scheduler, a divide\nerror could occur when hot adding a CPU. To fix this problem, the kernel\nscheduler time accounting has been reworked. (BZ#1134717)\n\n* The kernel did not handle exceptions caused by an invalid floating point\ncontrol (FPC) register, resulting in a kernel oops. This problem has been\nfixed by placing the label to handle these exceptions to the correct place\nin the code. (BZ#1138733)\n\n* A previous change to the kernel for the PowerPC architecture changed\nimplementation of the compat_sys_sendfile() function. Consequently, the\n64-bit sendfile() system call stopped working for files larger than 2 GB\non PowerPC. This update restores previous behavior of sendfile() on\nPowerPC, and it again process files bigger than 2 GB as expected.\n(BZ#1139126)\n\n* Previously, the kernel scheduler could schedule a CPU topology update\neven though the topology did not change. This could negatively affect the\nCPU load balancing, cause degradation of the system performance, and\neventually result in a kernel oops. This problem has been fixed by\nskipping the CPU topology update if the topology has not actually changed.\n(BZ#1140300)\n\n* Previously, recovery of a double-degraded RAID6 array could, under\ncertain circumstances, result in data corruption. This could happen\nbecause the md driver was using an optimization that is safe to use only\nfor single-degraded arrays. This update ensures that this optimization is\nskipped during the recovery of double-degraded RAID6 arrays. (BZ#1143850)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
