    "Title": "RHSA-2019:2964: patch security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The patch program applies diff files to originals. The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file. Diff lists the changes made to the file. A person who has the original file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file).\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* patch: do_ed_script in pch.c does not block strings beginning with a ! character (CVE-2018-20969)\n\n* patch: OS shell command injection when processing crafted patch files (CVE-2019-13638)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
