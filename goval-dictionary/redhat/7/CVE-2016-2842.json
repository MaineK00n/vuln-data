    "Title": "RHSA-2016:0722: openssl security update (Important)",
    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)\n\n* Two integer overflow flaws, leading to buffer overflows, were found in the way the EVP_EncodeUpdate() and EVP_EncryptUpdate() functions of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106)\n\n* It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when the connection used the AES CBC cipher suite and the server supported AES-NI. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a padding oracle. (CVE-2016-2107)\n\n* Several flaws were found in the way BIO_*printf functions were implemented in OpenSSL. Applications which passed large amounts of untrusted data through these functions could crash or potentially execute code with the permissions of the user running such an application. (CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-2842)\n\n* A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain ASN.1-encoded data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. An application using OpenSSL that accepts untrusted ASN.1 BIO input could be forced to allocate an excessive amount of data. (CVE-2016-2109)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108, CVE-2016-2842, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2107, and CVE-2016-0799.
