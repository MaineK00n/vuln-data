    "Title": "RHSA-2014:1281: kernel security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's\nsystem call auditing implementation. On a system with existing audit rules\ndefined, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak kernel\nmemory to user space or, potentially, crash the system. (CVE-2014-3917,\nModerate)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs: \n\n* A bug in the mtip32xx driver could prevent the Micron P420m PCIe SSD\ndevices with unaligned I/O access from completing the submitted I/O\nrequests. This resulted in a livelock situation and rendered the Micron\nP420m PCIe SSD devices unusable. To fix this problem, mtip32xx now checks\nwhether an I/O access is unaligned and if so, it uses the correct\nsemaphore. (BZ#1125776)\n\n* A series of patches has been backported to improve the functionality of\na touch pad on the latest Lenovo laptops in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n(BZ#1122559)\n\n* Due to a bug in the bnx2x driver, a network adapter could be unable to\nrecover from EEH error injection. The network adapter had to be taken\noffline and rebooted in order to function properly again. With this update,\nthe bnx2x driver has been corrected and network adapters now recover from\nEEH errors as expected. (BZ#1107722)\n\n* Previously, if an hrtimer interrupt was delayed, all future pending\nhrtimer events that were queued on the same processor were also delayed\nuntil the initial hrtimer event was handled. This could cause all hrtimer\nprocessing to stop for a significant period of time. To prevent this\nproblem, the kernel has been modified to handle all expired hrtimer events\nwhen handling the initially delayed hrtimer event. (BZ#1113175)\n\n* A previous change to the nouveau driver introduced a bit shift error,\nwhich resulted in a wrong display resolution being set with some models\nof NVIDIA controllers. With this update, the erroneous code has been\ncorrected, and the affected NVIDIA controllers can now set the correct\ndisplay resolution. (BZ#1114869)\n\n* Due to a NULL pointer dereference bug in the be2net driver, the system\ncould experience a kernel oops and reboot when disabling a network adapter\nafter a permanent failure. This problem has been fixed by introducing a\nflag to keep track of the setup state. The failing adapter can now be\ndisabled successfully without a kernel crash. (BZ#1122558)\n\n* Previously, the Huge Translation Lookaside Buffer (HugeTLB) allowed\naccess to huge pages access by default. However, huge pages may be\nunsupported in some environments, such as a KVM guest on a PowerPC\narchitecture, and an attempt to access a huge page in memory would result\nin a kernel oops. This update ensures that HugeTLB denies access to huge\npages if the huge pages are not supported on the system. (BZ#1122115)\n\n* If an NVMe device becomes ready but fails to create I/O queues, the nvme\ndriver creates a character device handle to manage such a device.\nPreviously, a character device could be created before a device reference\ncounter was initialized, which resulted in a kernel oops. This problem has\nbeen fixed by calling the relevant initialization function earlier in the\ncode. (BZ#1119720)\n\n* On some firmware versions of the BladeEngine 3 (BE3) controller,\ninterrupts remain disabled after a hardware reset. This was a problem for\nall Emulex-based network adapters using such a BE3 controller because\nthese adapters would fail to recover from an EEH error if it occurred. To\nresolve this problem, the be2net driver has been modified to enable the\ninterrupts in the eeh_resume handler explicitly. (BZ#1121712)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
