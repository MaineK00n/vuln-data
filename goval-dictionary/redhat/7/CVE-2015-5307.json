    "Title": "RHSA-2015:2552: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the x86 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is prone to\na denial of service attack inside a virtualized environment in the form of\nan infinite loop in the microcode due to the way (sequential) delivering of\nbenign exceptions such as #AC (alignment check exception) and #DB (debug\nexception) is handled. A privileged user inside a guest could use these\nflaws to create denial of service conditions on the host kernel.\n(CVE-2015-5307, CVE-2015-8104, Important)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ben Serebrin of Google Inc. for reporting the\nCVE-2015-5307 issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* On Intel Xeon v5 platforms, the processor frequency was always tied to\nthe highest possible frequency. Switching p-states on these client\nplatforms failed. This update sets the idle frequency, busy frequency, and\nprocessor frequency values by determining the range and adjusting the\nminimal and maximal percent limit values. Now, switching p-states on the\naforementioned client platforms proceeds successfully. (BZ#1273926)\n\n* Due to a validation error of in-kernel memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) tracing,\na VM became previously unresponsive when connected to Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor. The provided patch fixes this bug by dropping\nthe check in MMIO handler, and a VM continues running as expected.\n(BZ#1275150)\n\n* Due to retry-able command errors, the NVMe driver previously leaked I/O\ndescriptors and DMA mappings. As a consequence, the kernel could become\nunresponsive during the hot-unplug operation if a driver was removed.\nThis update fixes the driver memory leak bug on command retries, and the\nkernel no longer hangs in this situation. (BZ#1279792)\n\n* The hybrid_dma_data() function was not initialized before use, which\ncaused an invalid memory access when hot-plugging a PCI card. As a\nconsequence, a kernel oops occurred. The provided patch makes sure\nhybrid_dma_data() is initialized before use, and the kernel oops no longer\noccurs in this situation. (BZ#1279793)\n\n* When running PowerPC (PPC) KVM guests and the host was experiencing a lot\nof page faults, for example because it was running low on memory, the host\nsometimes triggered an incorrect kind of interrupt in the guest: a data\nstorage exception instead of a data segment exception. This caused a kernel\npanic of the PPC KVM guest. With this update, the host kernel synthesizes a\nsegment fault if the corresponding Segment Lookaside Buffer (SLB) lookup\nfails, which prevents the kernel panic from occurring. (BZ#1281423)\n\n* The kernel accessed an incorrect area of the khugepaged process causing\nLogical Partitioning (LPAR) to become unresponsive, and an oops occurred in\nmedlp5. The backported upstream patch prevents an LPAR hang, and the oops\nno longer occurs. (BZ#1281424)\n\n* When the sctp module was loaded and a route to an association endpoint\nwas removed after receiving an Out-of-The-Blue (OOTB) chunk but before\nincrementing the \"dropped because of missing route\" SNMP statistic, a Null\nPointer Dereference kernel panic previously occurred. This update fixes the\nrace condition between OOTB response and route removal. (BZ#1281426)\n\n* The cpuscaling test of the certification test suite previously failed due\nto a rounding bug in the intel-pstate driver. This bug has been fixed and\nthe cpuscaling test now passes. (BZ#1281491)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
