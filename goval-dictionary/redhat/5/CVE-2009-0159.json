    "Description": "The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time\nwith a referenced time source.\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4\nauthentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key cryptography\nfor NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could use this flaw to\nsend a specially-crafted request packet that could crash ntpd.\n(CVE-2009-1252)\n\nNote: NTP authentication is not enabled by default.\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A\nmalicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an ntpq\nrequest that could crash ntpq. (CVE-2009-0159)\n\nAll ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the ntpd daemon will be restarted automatically.",
