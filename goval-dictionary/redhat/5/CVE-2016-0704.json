    "Title": "RHSA-2015:0800: openssl security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL would accept ephemeral RSA keys when using\nnon-export RSA cipher suites. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL\nclient using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method. (CVE-2015-0204)\n\nAn integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the\nway OpenSSL decoded malformed Base64-encoded inputs. An attacker able to\nmake an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted Base64-encoded\ninput (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application to\ncrash. Note: this flaw is not exploitable via the TLS/SSL protocol because\nthe data being transferred is not Base64-encoded. (CVE-2015-0292)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2\nhandshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\nTLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both\nthe SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way OpenSSL parsed X.509 certificates.\nAn attacker could use these flaws to modify an X.509 certificate to produce\na certificate with a different fingerprint without invalidating its\nsignature, and possibly bypass fingerprint-based blacklisting in\napplications. (CVE-2014-8275)\n\nAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way OpenSSL reused certain\nASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could possibly use a specially crafted\nASN.1 structure that, when parsed by an application, would cause that\napplication to crash. (CVE-2015-0287)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenSSL's X.509 certificate\nhandling implementation. A specially crafted X.509 certificate could cause\nan application using OpenSSL to crash if the application attempted to\nconvert the certificate to a certificate request. (CVE-2015-0288)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain\nPKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL\nverify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that\napplication to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not\naffected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0289)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting \nCVE-2015-0287, CVE-2015-0288, CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0292, and \nCVE-2015-0293. Upstream acknowledges Emilia Käsper of the OpenSSL \ndevelopment team as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0287, Brian Carpenter \nas the original reporter of CVE-2015-0288, Michal Zalewski of Google as the \noriginal reporter of CVE-2015-0289, Robert Dugal and David Ramos as the \noriginal reporters of CVE-2015-0292, and Sean Burford of Google and Emilia \nKäsper of the OpenSSL development team as the original reporters of \nCVE-2015-0293.\n\nAll openssl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take\neffect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or\nthe system rebooted.",
