    "Title": "RHSA-2007:0951: nfs-utils-lib security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The nfs-utils-lib package contains support libraries that are needed by the\ncommands and daemons of the nfs-utils package.\n\nThe updated nfs-utils package fixes the following vulnerabilities:\n\nTenable Network Security discovered a stack buffer overflow flaw in the RPC\nlibrary used by nfs-utils-lib. A remote unauthenticated attacker who can\naccess an application linked against nfs-utils-lib could trigger this flaw\nand cause the application to crash. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 it is not\npossible to exploit this flaw to run arbitrary code as the overflow is\nblocked by FORTIFY_SOURCE. (CVE-2007-3999)\n\nTony Ernst from SGI has discovered a flaw in the way nfsidmap maps NFSv4\nunknown uids.  If an unknown user ID is encountered on an NFSv4 mounted\nfilesystem, the files will default to being owned by 'root' rather than\n'nobody'. (CVE-2007-4135)\n\nUsers of nfs-utils-lib are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contains backported patches to resolve these issues.",
