    "Title": "RHSA-2009:0411: device-mapper-multipath security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The device-mapper multipath packages provide tools to manage multipath\ndevices by issuing instructions to the device-mapper multipath kernel\nmodule, and by managing the creation and removal of partitions for\ndevice-mapper devices.\n\nIt was discovered that the multipathd daemon set incorrect permissions on\nthe socket used to communicate with command line clients. An unprivileged,\nlocal user could use this flaw to send commands to multipathd, resulting in\naccess disruptions to storage devices accessible via multiple paths and,\npossibly, file system corruption on these devices. (CVE-2009-0115)\n\nUsers of device-mapper-multipath are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. The\nmultipathd service must be restarted for the changes to take effect.\n\nImportant: the version of the multipathd daemon in Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n5 has a known issue which may cause a machine to become unresponsive when\nthe multipathd service is stopped. This issue is tracked in the Bugzilla\nbug #494582; a link is provided in the References section of this erratum.\nUntil this issue is resolved, we recommend restarting the multipathd\nservice by issuing the following commands in sequence:\n\n\t# killall -KILL multipathd\n\n\t# service multipathd restart",
