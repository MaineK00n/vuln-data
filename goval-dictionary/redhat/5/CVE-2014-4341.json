    "Title": "RHSA-2014:1245: krb5 security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Kerberos is an authentication system which allows clients and services to\nauthenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third party, a\nKerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).\n\nIt was found that if a KDC served multiple realms, certain requests could\ncause the setup_server_realm() function to dereference a NULL pointer.\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash the KDC\nusing a specially crafted request. (CVE-2013-1418, CVE-2013-6800)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MIT Kerberos SPNEGO\nacceptor for continuation tokens. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could\nuse this flaw to crash a GSSAPI-enabled server application. (CVE-2014-4344)\n\nA buffer over-read flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos handled certain\nrequests. A man-in-the-middle attacker with a valid Kerberos ticket who is\nable to inject packets into a client or server application's GSSAPI session\ncould use this flaw to crash the application. (CVE-2014-4341)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the libkrb5 library occasionally attempted to free\nalready freed memory when encrypting credentials. As a consequence, the\ncalling process terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault.\nWith this update, libkrb5 frees memory correctly, which allows the\ncredentials to be encrypted appropriately and thus prevents the mentioned\ncrash. (BZ#1004632)\n\n* Previously, when the krb5 client library was waiting for a response from\na server, the timeout variable in certain cases became a negative number.\nConsequently, the client could enter a loop while checking for responses.\nWith this update, the client logic has been modified and the described\nerror no longer occurs. (BZ#1089732)\n\nAll krb5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdated packages, the krb5kdc daemon will be restarted automatically.",
