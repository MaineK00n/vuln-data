    "Title": "RHSA-2011:0427: spice-xpi security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a\nremote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing\nvirtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)\nhypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.\n\nThe spice-xpi package provides a plug-in that allows the SPICE client to\nrun from within Mozilla Firefox.\n\nAn uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the SPICE Firefox plug-in.\nIf a user were tricked into visiting a malicious web page with Firefox\nwhile the SPICE plug-in was enabled, it could cause Firefox to crash or,\npossibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nFirefox. (CVE-2011-1179)\n\nUsers of spice-xpi should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue. After installing the update,\nFirefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.",
