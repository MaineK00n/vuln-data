    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0124: systemtap security update (Important)",
    "Description": "SystemTap is an instrumentation system for systems running the Linux\nkernel, version 2.6. Developers can write scripts to collect data on the\noperation of the system.\n\nA flaw was found in the SystemTap compile server, stap-server, an optional\ncomponent of SystemTap. This server did not adequately sanitize input\nprovided by the stap-client program, which may allow a remote user to\nexecute arbitrary shell code with the privileges of the compile server\nprocess, which could possibly be running as the root user. (CVE-2009-4273)\n\nNote: stap-server is not run by default. It must be started by a user or\nadministrator.\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in SystemTap's tapset __get_argv()\nfunction. If a privileged user ran a SystemTap script that called this\nfunction, a local, unprivileged user could, while that script is still\nrunning, trigger this flaw and cause memory corruption by running a command\nwith a large argument list, which may lead to a system crash or,\npotentially, arbitrary code execution with root privileges. (CVE-2010-0411)\n\nNote: SystemTap scripts that call __get_argv(), being a privileged\nfunction, can only be executed by the root user or users in the stapdev\ngroup. As well, if such a script was compiled and installed by root, users\nin the stapusr group would also be able to execute it.\n\nSystemTap users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.",
