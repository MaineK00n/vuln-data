    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0679: rpm security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package management\nsystem capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and\nupdating software packages.\n\nIt was discovered that RPM did not remove setuid and setgid bits set on\nbinaries when upgrading packages. A local attacker able to create hard\nlinks to binaries could use this flaw to keep those binaries on the system,\nat a specific version level and with the setuid or setgid bit set, even if\nthe package providing them was upgraded by a system administrator. This\ncould have security implications if a package was upgraded because of a\nsecurity flaw in a setuid or setgid program. (CVE-2010-2059)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* A memory leak in the communication between RPM and the Security-Enhanced\nLinux (SELinux) subsystem, which could have caused extensive memory\nconsumption. In reported cases, this issue was triggered by running\nrhn_check when errata were scheduled to be applied. (BZ#627630)\n\nAll users of rpm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
