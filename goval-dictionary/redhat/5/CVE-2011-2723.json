    "Title": "RHSA-2011:1321: kernel security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel.\n\nSecurity fix:\n\n* A flaw in skb_gro_header_slow() in the Linux kernel could lead to GRO\n(Generic Receive Offload) fields being left in an inconsistent state. An\nattacker on the local network could use this flaw to trigger a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2011-2723, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Brent Meshier for reporting this issue.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* When reading a file from a subdirectory in /proc/bus/pci/ while\nhot-unplugging the device related to that file, the system will crash. Now,\nthe kernel correctly handles the simultaneous removal of a device and\naccess to the representation of that device in the proc file system.\n(BZ#713454)\n\n* RHSA-2011:0017 introduced a regression: Non-disk SCSI devices (except for\ntape drives) such as enclosure or CD-ROM devices were hidden when attached\nto a SAS based RAID controller that uses the megaraid_sas driver. With this\nupdate, such devices are accessible, as expected. (BZ#726487)\n\n* The fix for CVE-2010-3432 provided in RHSA-2011:0004 introduced a\nregression: Information in sctp_packet_config(), which was called before\nappending data chunks to a packet, was not reset, causing considerably poor\nSCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) performance. With this update,\nthe packet information is reset after transmission. (BZ#727591)\n\n* Certain systems do not correctly set the ACPI FADT APIC mode bit. They\nset the bit to \"cluster\" mode instead of \"physical\" mode which caused these\nsystems to boot without the TSC (Time Stamp Counter). With this update, the\nACPI FADT check has been removed due to its unreliability. (BZ#728162)\n\n* Performance when invalidating and rereading cached data as a glock moves\naround the cluster with GFS2 is improved. (BZ#729082)\n\n* Performance issues occurred when multiple nodes attempted to call mmap()\non the same inode at the same time on a GFS2 file system, as it was using\nan exclusive glock. With this update, a shared lock is used when \"noatime\"\nis set on the mount, allowing mmap() operations to occur in parallel,\nfixing this bug. Note that this issue only refers to mmap() system calls,\nand not to subsequent page faults. (BZ#729090)\n\n* Some of the functions in the GFS2 file system were not reserving enough\nspace for the resource group header in a transaction and for resource\ngroups bit blocks that get added when a memory allocation is performed.\nThat resulted in failed write and allocation operations. With this update,\nGFS2 makes sure to reserve space in the described scenario, using the new\ngfs2_rg_blocks() inline function. (BZ#729092)\n\n* When GFS2 grew the file system, it never reread the rindex file during\nthe grow. This is necessary for large grows when the file system is almost\nfull, and GFS2 needs to use some of the space allocated earlier in the grow\nto complete it. Now, if GFS2 fails to reserve the necessary space and the\nrindex data is not up-to-date, it rereads it. (BZ#729094)\n\n* Previously, when the Xen hypervisor split a 2 MB page into 4 KB pages, it\nlinked the new page from PDE (Page Directory Entry) before it filled\nentries of the page with appropriate data. Consequently, when doing a live\nmigration with EPT (Extended Page Tables) enabled on a non-idle guest\nrunning with more than two virtual CPUs, the guest often terminated\nunexpectedly. With this update, the Xen hypervisor prepares the page table\nentry first, and then links it in. (BZ#730684)\n\n* Changes made to TSC as a clock source for IRQs caused virtual machines\nrunning under the VMware ESX or ESXi hypervisors to become unresponsive\nduring the initial kernel boot process. With this update, the\nenable_tsc_timer flag enables the do_timer_tsc_timekeeping() function to be\ncalled in the do_timer_interrupt_hook() function, preventing a deadlock in\nthe timer interrupt handler. (BZ#730688)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",

    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* The maximum file offset handling for ext4 file systems could allow a\nlocal, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695,\nImportant)\n\n* IPv6 fragment identification value generation could allow a remote\nattacker to disrupt a target system's networking, preventing legitimate\nusers from accessing its services. (CVE-2011-2699, Important)\n\n* A malicious CIFS (Common Internet File System) server could send a\nspecially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in\na denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS\nshare mounted. (CVE-2011-3191, Important)\n\n* A local attacker could use mount.ecryptfs_private to mount (and then\naccess) a directory they would otherwise not have access to. Note: To\ncorrect this issue, the RHSA-2011:1241 ecryptfs-utils update must also be\ninstalled. (CVE-2011-1833, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw in the taskstats subsystem could allow a local, unprivileged user\nto cause excessive CPU time and memory use. (CVE-2011-2484, Moderate)\n\n* Mapping expansion handling could allow a local, unprivileged user to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2496, Moderate)\n\n* GRO (Generic Receive Offload) fields could be left in an inconsistent\nstate. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service. GRO is enabled by default in all network drivers that\nsupport it. (CVE-2011-2723, Moderate)\n\n* RHSA-2011:1065 introduced a regression in the Ethernet bridge\nimplementation. If a system had an interface in a bridge, and an attacker\non the local network could send packets to that interface, they could cause\na denial of service on that system. Xen hypervisor and KVM (Kernel-based\nVirtual Machine) hosts often deploy bridge interfaces. (CVE-2011-2942,\nModerate)\n\n* A flaw in the Xen hypervisor IOMMU error handling implementation could\nallow a privileged guest user, within a guest operating system that has\ndirect control of a PCI device, to cause performance degradation on the\nhost and possibly cause it to hang. (CVE-2011-3131, Moderate)\n\n* IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence number and fragment ID generation could\nallow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and possibly hijack\nconnections. Protocol sequence number and fragment IDs are now more random.\n(CVE-2011-3188, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw in the kernel's clock implementation could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3209, Moderate)\n\n* Non-member VLAN (virtual LAN) packet handling for interfaces in\npromiscuous mode and also using the be2net driver could allow an attacker\non the local network to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3347,\nModerate)\n\n* A flaw in the auerswald USB driver could allow a local, unprivileged user\nto cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges by inserting a\nspecially-crafted USB device. (CVE-2009-4067, Low)\n\n* A flaw in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) implementation could allow a\nlocal, unprivileged user to leak information to user space. (CVE-2011-1160,\nLow)\n\n* A local, unprivileged user could possibly mount a CIFS share that\nrequires authentication without knowing the correct password if the mount\nwas already mounted by another local user. (CVE-2011-1585, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Fernando Gont for reporting CVE-2011-2699;\nDarren Lavender for reporting CVE-2011-3191; the Ubuntu Security Team for\nreporting CVE-2011-1833; Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting\nCVE-2011-2484; Robert Swiecki for reporting CVE-2011-2496; Brent Meshier\nfor reporting CVE-2011-2723; Dan Kaminsky for reporting CVE-2011-3188;\nYasuaki Ishimatsu for reporting CVE-2011-3209; Somnath Kotur for reporting\nCVE-2011-3347; Rafael Dominguez Vega for reporting CVE-2009-4067; and Peter\nHuewe for reporting CVE-2011-1160.
