    "Title": "RHSA-2009:0479: perl-DBD-Pg security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Perl DBI is a database access Application Programming Interface (API) for\nthe Perl language. perl-DBD-Pg allows Perl applications to access\nPostgreSQL database servers.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the pg_getline function\nimplementation. If the pg_getline or getline functions read large,\nuntrusted records from a database, it could cause an application using\nthese functions to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2009-0663)\n\nNote: After installing this update, pg_getline may return more data than\nspecified by its second argument, as this argument will be ignored. This is\nconsistent with current upstream behavior. Previously, the length limit\n(the second argument) was not enforced, allowing a buffer overflow.\n\nA memory leak flaw was found in the function performing the de-quoting of\nBYTEA type values acquired from a database. An attacker able to cause an\napplication using perl-DBD-Pg to perform a large number of SQL queries\nreturning BYTEA records, could cause the application to use excessive\namounts of memory or, possibly, crash. (CVE-2009-1341)\n\nAll users of perl-DBD-Pg are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contains backported patches to fix these issues. Applications using\nperl-DBD-Pg must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
