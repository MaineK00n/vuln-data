    "Title": "RHSA-2007:0631: coolkey security and bug fix update (Low)",
    "Description": "coolkey contains the driver support for the CoolKey and Common Access Card\n(CAC) Smart Card products. The CAC is used by the U.S. Government.\n\nSteve Grubb discovered a flaw in the way coolkey created a temporary\ndirectory. A local attacker could perform a symlink attack and cause\narbitrary files to be overwritten. (CVE-2007-4129)\n\nIn addition, the updated packages contain fixes for the following bugs in\nthe CAC Smart Card support:\n\n* CAC Smart Cards can have from 1 to 3 certificates. The coolkey driver,\nhowever, was not recognizing cards if they had less than 3 certificates.\n\n* logging into a CAC Smart Card token with a new application would cause\nother, already authenticated, applications to lose their login status\nunless the Smart Card was then removed from the reader and re-inserted.\n\nAll CAC users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these\nissues.",
