    "Description": "Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI\noperating system facilities. These facilities include threads, thread\nsynchronization, normal file and network I/O, interval timing, calendar\ntime, basic memory management (malloc and free), and shared library linking.\n\nNetwork Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support\nthe cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server\napplications. Applications built with NSS can support SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS,\nand other security standards.\n\nThese updated packages upgrade NSS from the previous version, 3.12.2, to a\nprerelease of version 3.12.4. The version of NSPR has also been upgraded\nfrom 4.7.3 to 4.7.4. \n\nMoxie Marlinspike reported a heap overflow flaw in a regular expression\nparser in the NSS library used by browsers such as Mozilla Firefox to match\ncommon names in certificates. A malicious website could present a\ncarefully-crafted certificate in such a way as to trigger the heap\noverflow, leading to a crash or, possibly, arbitrary code execution with\nthe permissions of the user running the browser. (CVE-2009-2404)\n\nNote: in order to exploit this issue without further user interaction in\nFirefox, the carefully-crafted certificate would need to be signed by a\nCertificate Authority trusted by Firefox, otherwise Firefox presents the\nvictim with a warning that the certificate is untrusted. Only if the user\nthen accepts the certificate will the overflow take place.\n\nDan Kaminsky discovered flaws in the way browsers such as Firefox handle\nNULL characters in a certificate. If an attacker is able to get a\ncarefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority trusted by\nFirefox, the attacker could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle\nattack and potentially confuse Firefox into accepting it by mistake.\n(CVE-2009-2408)\n\nDan Kaminsky found that browsers still accept certificates with MD2 hash\nsignatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically\nstrong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a\nmalicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a browser. NSS\nnow disables the use of MD2 and MD4 algorithms inside signatures by\ndefault. (CVE-2009-2409)\n\nAll users of nspr and nss are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich resolve these issues and add an enhancement.",

    "Description": "These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the\nOpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)\ncontains the software and tools that users need to run applications written\nusing the Java programming language.\n\nAn integer overflow flaw and buffer overflow flaws were found in the way\nthe JRE processed image files. An untrusted applet or application could use\nthese flaws to extend its privileges, allowing it to read and write local\nfiles, as well as to execute local applications with the privileges of the\nuser running the applet or application. (CVE-2009-3869, CVE-2009-3871,\nCVE-2009-3873, CVE-2009-3874)\n\nAn information leak was found in the JRE. An untrusted applet or\napplication could use this flaw to extend its privileges, allowing it to\nread and write local files, as well as to execute local applications with\nthe privileges of the user running the applet or application. (CVE-2009-3881)\n\nIt was discovered that the JRE still accepts certificates with MD2 hash\nsignatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically\nstrong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a\nmalicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by the JRE. With\nthis update, the JRE disables the use of the MD2 algorithm inside\nsignatures by default. (CVE-2009-2409)\n\nA timing attack flaw was found in the way the JRE processed HMAC digests.\nThis flaw could aid an attacker using forged digital signatures to bypass\nauthentication checks. (CVE-2009-3875)\n\nTwo denial of service flaws were found in the JRE. These could be exploited\nin server-side application scenarios that process DER-encoded\n(Distinguished Encoding Rules) data. (CVE-2009-3876, CVE-2009-3877)\n\nAn information leak was found in the way the JRE handled color profiles. An\nattacker could use this flaw to discover the existence of files outside of\nthe color profiles directory. (CVE-2009-3728)\n\nA flaw in the JRE with passing arrays to the X11GraphicsDevice API was\nfound. An untrusted applet or application could use this flaw to access and\nmodify the list of supported graphics configurations. This flaw could also\nlead to sensitive information being leaked to unprivileged code.\n(CVE-2009-3879)\n\nIt was discovered that the JRE passed entire objects to the logging API.\nThis could lead to sensitive information being leaked to either untrusted\nor lower-privileged code from an attacker-controlled applet which has\naccess to the logging API and is therefore able to manipulate (read and/or\ncall) the passed objects. (CVE-2009-3880)\n\nPotential information leaks were found in various mutable static variables.\nThese could be exploited in application scenarios that execute untrusted\nscripting code. (CVE-2009-3882, CVE-2009-3883)\n\nAn information leak was found in the way the TimeZone.getTimeZone method\nwas handled. This method could load time zone files that are outside of the\n[JRE_HOME]/lib/zi/ directory, allowing a remote attacker to probe the local\nfile system. (CVE-2009-3884)\n\nNote: The flaws concerning applets in this advisory, CVE-2009-3869,\nCVE-2009-3871, CVE-2009-3873, CVE-2009-3874, CVE-2009-3879, CVE-2009-3880,\nCVE-2009-3881 and CVE-2009-3884, can only be triggered in\njava-1.6.0-openjdk by calling the \"appletviewer\" application.\n\nAll users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java\nmust be restarted for the update to take effect.",

    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nIt was found that the OpenSSL library did not properly re-initialize its\ninternal state in the SSL_library_init() function after previous calls to\nthe CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data() function, which would cause a memory leak\nfor each subsequent SSL connection. This flaw could cause server\napplications that call those functions during reload, such as a combination\nof the Apache HTTP Server, mod_ssl, PHP, and cURL, to consume all available\nmemory, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2009-4355)\n\nDan Kaminsky found that browsers could accept certificates with MD2 hash\nsignatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically\nstrong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a\nmalicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a browser.\nOpenSSL now disables the use of the MD2 algorithm inside signatures by\ndefault. (CVE-2009-2409)\n\nAll OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,\nall services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system\nrebooted.",
