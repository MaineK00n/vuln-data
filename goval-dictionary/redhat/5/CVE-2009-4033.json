    "Title": "RHSA-2009:1642: acpid security update (Important)",
    "Description": "acpid is a daemon that dispatches ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power\nInterface) events to user-space programs.\n\nIt was discovered that acpid could create its log file (\"/var/log/acpid\")\nwith random permissions on some systems. A local attacker could use this\nflaw to escalate their privileges if the log file was created as\nworld-writable and with the setuid or setgid bit set. (CVE-2009-4033)\n\nPlease note that this flaw was due to a Red Hat-specific patch\n(acpid-1.0.4-fd.patch) included in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 acpid\npackage.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.",
