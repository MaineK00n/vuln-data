    "Title": "RHSA-2007:0940: kernel security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThese new kernel packages contain fixes for the following security issues:\n\n* A flaw was found in the backported stack unwinder fixes in Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5.  On AMD64 and Intel 64 platforms, a local user could\ntrigger this flaw and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-4574, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the handling of process death signals. This allowed a\nlocal user to send arbitrary signals to the suid-process executed by that\nuser. A successful exploitation of this flaw depends on the structure of\nthe suid-program and its signal handling. (CVE-2007-3848, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) in the cluster\nmanager. This allowed a remote user who is able to connect to the DLM port\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-3380, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the aacraid SCSI driver. This allowed a local user to\nmake ioctl calls to the driver which should otherwise be restricted to\nprivileged users. (CVE-2007-4308, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the prio_tree handling of the hugetlb support that\nallowed a local user to cause a denial of service. This only affected\nkernels with hugetlb support. (CVE-2007-4133, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the eHCA driver on PowerPC architectures that allowed\na local user to access 60k of physical address space. This address space\ncould contain sensitive information. (CVE-2007-3850, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in ptrace support that allowed a local user to cause a\ndenial of service via a NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2007-3731, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the usblcd driver that allowed a local user to cause\na denial\nof service by writing data to the device node. To exploit this issue, write\naccess to the device node was needed. (CVE-2007-3513, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the random number generator implementation that\nallowed a local user to cause a denial of service or possibly gain\nprivileges. If the root user raised the default wakeup threshold over the\nsize of the output pool, this flaw could be exploited. (CVE-2007-3105, Low)\n\nIn addition to the security issues described above, several bug fixes\npreventing possible system crashes and data corruption were also included.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to upgrade to these packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to resolve these issues.",
