    "Title": "RHSA-2013:0769: glibc security and bug fix update (Low)",
    "Description": "The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread\nlibraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server\nCaching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without\nthese libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.\n\nIt was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory\nused during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application\nresolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause\nthe application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)\n\nA flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process\nmultibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular\nexpression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted\ninput that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.\n(CVE-2013-0242)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The improvements RHSA-2012:1207 made to the accuracy of floating point\nfunctions in the math library caused performance regressions for those\nfunctions. The performance regressions were analyzed and a fix was applied\nthat retains the current accuracy but reduces the performance penalty to\nacceptable levels. Refer to Red Hat Knowledge solution 229993, linked\nto in the References, for further information. (BZ#950535)\n\n* It was possible that a memory location freed by the localization code\ncould be accessed immediately after, resulting in a crash. The fix ensures\nthat the application does not crash by avoiding the invalid memory access.\n(BZ#951493)\n\nUsers of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
