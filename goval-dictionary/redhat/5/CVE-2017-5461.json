    "Description": "Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way NSS performed certain Base64-decoding operations. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when parsed by NSS, could cause it to crash or execute arbitrary code, using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the NSS library. (CVE-2017-5461)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Ronald Crane as the original reporter.",
