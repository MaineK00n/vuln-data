    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0387: firefox security and bug fix update (Critical)",
    "Description": "Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web\npage containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning Firefox. (CVE-2012-0461, CVE-2012-0462, CVE-2012-0464)\n\nTwo flaws were found in the way Firefox parsed certain Scalable Vector\nGraphics (SVG) image files. A web page containing a malicious SVG image\nfile could cause an information leak, or cause Firefox to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nFirefox. (CVE-2012-0456, CVE-2012-0457)\n\nA flaw could allow a malicious site to bypass intended restrictions,\npossibly leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack if a user were\ntricked into dropping a \"javascript:\" link onto a frame. (CVE-2012-0455)\n\nIt was found that the home page could be set to a \"javascript:\" link. If a\nuser were tricked into setting such a home page by dragging a link to the\nhome button, it could cause Firefox to repeatedly crash, eventually\nleading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user\nrunning Firefox. (CVE-2012-0458)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox parsed certain web content containing\n\"cssText\". A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to\ncrash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0459)\n\nIt was found that by using the DOM fullscreen API, untrusted content could\nbypass the mozRequestFullscreen security protections. A web page containing\nmalicious web content could exploit this API flaw to cause user interface\nspoofing. (CVE-2012-0460)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled pages with multiple Content\nSecurity Policy (CSP) headers. This could lead to a cross-site scripting\nattack if used in conjunction with a website that has a header injection\nflaw. (CVE-2012-0451)\n\nFor technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security\nadvisories for Firefox 10.0.3 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla\nadvisories in the References section of this erratum.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When using the Traditional Chinese locale (zh-TW), a segmentation fault\nsometimes occurred when closing Firefox. (BZ#729632)\n\n* Inputting any text in the Web Console (Tools -\u003e Web Developer -\u003e\nWeb Console) caused Firefox to crash. (BZ#784048)\n\n* The java-1.6.0-ibm-plugin and java-1.6.0-sun-plugin packages require the\n\"/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/\" directory on 32-bit systems, and the\n\"/usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins/\" directory on 64-bit systems. These\ndirectories are created by the xulrunner package; however, they were\nmissing from the xulrunner package provided by the RHEA-2012:0327 update.\nTherefore, upgrading to RHEA-2012:0327 removed those directories, causing\ndependency errors when attempting to install the java-1.6.0-ibm-plugin or\njava-1.6.0-sun-plugin package. With this update, xulrunner once again\ncreates the plugins directory. This issue did not affect users of Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 6. (BZ#799042)\n\nAll Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nFirefox version 10.0.3 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing\nthe update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.",
