    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0675: sudo security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give\ncertain users the ability to run commands as root.\n\nA flaw was found in the way sudo handled Runas specifications containing\nboth a user and a group list. If a local user were authorized by the\nsudoers file to perform their sudo commands with the privileges of a\nspecified user and group, they could use this flaw to run those commands\nwith the privileges of either an arbitrary user or group on the system.\n(CVE-2010-2956)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Markus Wuethrich of Swiss Post - PostFinance\nfor reporting this issue.\n\nUsers of sudo should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.",
