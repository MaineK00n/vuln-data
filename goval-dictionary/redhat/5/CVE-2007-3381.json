    "Description": "Gdm (the GNOME Display Manager) is a highly configurable reimplementation\nof xdm, the X Display Manager. Gdm allows you to log into your system with\nthe X Window System running and supports running several different X\nsessions on your local machine at the same time.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Gdm listens on its unix domain socket.  A local\nuser could crash a running X session by writing malicious data to Gdm's\nunix domain socket. (CVE-2007-3381)\n\nAll users of gdm should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch that resolves this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank JLANTHEA for reporting this issue.",
