    "Title": "RHSA-2014:0266: sudo security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give\ncertain users the ability to run commands as root.\n\nA flaw was found in the way sudo handled its blacklist of environment\nvariables. When the \"env_reset\" option was disabled, a user permitted to\nrun certain commands via sudo could use this flaw to run such a command\nwith one of the blacklisted environment variables set, allowing them to run\nan arbitrary command with the target user's privileges. (CVE-2014-0106)\n\nNote: This issue does not affect the default configuration of the sudo\npackage as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Todd C. Miller for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Sebastien Macke as the original reporter.\n\nAll sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue.",
