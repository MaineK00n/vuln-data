    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0565: w3m security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The w3m program is a pager (or text file viewer) that can also be used as a\ntext mode web browser.\n\nIt was discovered that w3m is affected by the previously published \"null\nprefix attack\", caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509\ncertificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted certificate\nsigned by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could use the\ncertificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse w3m\ninto accepting it by mistake. (CVE-2010-2074)\n\nAll w3m users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.",
