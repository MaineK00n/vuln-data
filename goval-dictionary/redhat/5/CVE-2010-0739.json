    "Description": "teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of\nformatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice\nIndependent (DVI) file as output.\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way teTeX processed\nspecial commands when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker\ncould create a malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to\ncrash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0739,\nCVE-2010-1440)\n\nMultiple array index errors were found in the way teTeX converted DVI files\ninto the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format. An attacker could create a\nmalicious DVI file that would cause the dvipng executable to crash.\n(CVE-2010-0829)\n\nteTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)\nfile viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF\ndocuments. The following issues affect Xpdf code:\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a\nlocal user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a\nspecially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.\n(CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-1179)\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf. If a local user\ngenerated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a specially-crafted\nPDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0791,\nCVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a\nlocal user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a\nspecially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.\n(CVE-2009-0195)\n\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a\nlocal user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a\nspecially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.\n(CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-1182)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder that could lead to the\nfreeing of arbitrary memory. If a local user generated a PDF file from a\nTeX document, referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause\nXpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0166, CVE-2009-1180)\n\nMultiple input validation flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a\nlocal user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a\nspecially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.\n(CVE-2009-0800)\n\nMultiple denial of service flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a\nlocal user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a\nspecially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash. (CVE-2009-0799,\nCVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1183)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Braden Thomas and Drew Yao of the Apple Product\nSecurity team, Will Dormann of the CERT/CC, Alin Rad Pop of Secunia\nResearch, and Chris Rohlf, for responsibly reporting the Xpdf flaws.\n\nAll users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
