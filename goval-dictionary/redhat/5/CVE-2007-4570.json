    "Title": "RHSA-2007:0542: mcstrans security and bug fix update (Low)",
    "Description": "mcstrans is the translation daemon used on SELinux machines to translate\nprogram context into human readable form.\n\nAn algorithmic complexity weakness was found in the way the mcstrans daemon\nhandled ranges of compartments in sensitivity labels. A local user could\ntrigger this flaw causing mctransd to temporarily stop responding to other\nrequests; a partial denial of service.  (CVE-2007-4570)\n\nThis update also fixes a problem where the mcstrans daemon was preventing\nSSH connections into an SELinux box, that was running a Multi-Level\nSecurity (MLS) Policy with multiple categories.\n\nUsers of mcstrans are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves this issue.",
