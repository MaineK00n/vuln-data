    "Title": "RHSA-2009:1193: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* the possibility of a timeout value overflow was found in the Linux kernel\nhigh-resolution timers functionality, hrtimers. This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service\n(kernel panic). (CVE-2007-5966, Important)\n\n* a flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in the Linux\nkernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across\nmultiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak\nthrough a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that\nwould cause a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1385,\nImportant)\n\n* Michael Tokarev reported a flaw in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in\nthe Linux kernel. This driver allowed interfaces using this driver to\nreceive frames larger than could be handled, which could lead to a remote\ndenial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1389, Important)\n\n* the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags were not cleared when a\nsetuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism and perform a\nNULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout\nRandomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)\n\n* Ramon de Carvalho Valle reported two flaws in the Linux kernel eCryptfs\nimplementation. A local attacker with permissions to perform an eCryptfs\nmount could modify the metadata of the files in that eCrypfts mount to\ncause a buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service or privilege\nescalation. (CVE-2009-2406, CVE-2009-2407, Important)\n\n* Konstantin Khlebnikov discovered a race condition in the ptrace\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. This race condition can occur when the\nprocess tracing and the process being traced participate in a core dump. A\nlocal, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger a deadlock,\nresulting in a partial denial of service. (CVE-2009-1388, Moderate)\n\nBug fixes (see References below for a link to more detailed notes):\n\n* possible dom0 crash when a Xen para-virtualized guest was installed while\nanother para-virtualized guest was rebooting. (BZ#497812)\n\n* no directory removal audit record if the directory and its subtree were\nrecursively watched by an audit rule. (BZ#507561)\n\n* running \"echo 1 \u003e /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\" under high memory load could\ncause a kernel panic. (BZ#503692)\n\n* on 32-bit systems, core dumps for some multithreaded applications did not\ninclude all thread information. (BZ#505322)\n\n* a stack buffer used by get_event_name() was too small for nul terminator\nsprintf() writes. This could lead to an invalid pointer or kernel panic.\n(BZ#506906)\n\n* when using the aic94xx driver, systems with SATA drives may not boot due\nto a libsas bug. (BZ#506029)\n\n* Wacom Cintiq 21UX and Intuos stylus buttons were handled incorrectly when\nmoved away from and back to these tablets. (BZ#508275)\n\n* CPU \"soft lockup\" messages and possibe system hangs on systems with\ncertain Broadcom network devices and running the Linux kernel from the\nkernel-xen package. (BZ#503689)\n\n* on 64-bit PowerPC, getitimer() failed for programs using the ITIMER_REAL\ntimer that were also compiled for 64-bit systems. This caused such programs\nto abort. (BZ#510018)\n\n* write operations could be blocked even when using O_NONBLOCK. (BZ#510239)\n\n* the \"pci=nomsi\" option was required for installing and booting Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5.2 on systems with VIA VT3364 chipsets. (BZ#507529)\n\n* shutting down, destroying, or migrating Xen guests with large amounts of\nmemory could cause other guests to be temporarily unresponsive. (BZ#512311)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. Systems must be rebooted for this update\nto take effect.",
