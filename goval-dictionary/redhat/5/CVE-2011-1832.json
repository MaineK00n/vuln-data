    "Title": "RHSA-2011:1241: ecryptfs-utils security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "eCryptfs is a stacked, cryptographic file system. It is transparent to the\nunderlying file system and provides per-file granularity. eCryptfs is\nreleased as a Technology Preview for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.\n\nThe setuid mount.ecryptfs_private utility allows users to mount an eCryptfs\nfile system. This utility can only be run by users in the \"ecryptfs\" group.\n\nA race condition flaw was found in the way mount.ecryptfs_private checked\nthe permissions of a requested mount point when mounting an encrypted file\nsystem. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to escalate their\nprivileges by mounting over an arbitrary directory. (CVE-2011-1831)\n\nA race condition flaw in umount.ecryptfs_private could allow a local\nattacker to unmount an arbitrary file system. (CVE-2011-1832)\n\nIt was found that mount.ecryptfs_private did not handle certain errors\ncorrectly when updating the mtab (mounted file systems table) file,\nallowing a local attacker to corrupt the mtab file and possibly unmount an\narbitrary file system. (CVE-2011-1834)\n\nAn insecure temporary file use flaw was found in the ecryptfs-setup-private\nscript. A local attacker could use this script to insert their own key that\nwill subsequently be used by a new user, possibly giving the attacker\naccess to the user's encrypted data if existing file permissions allow\naccess. (CVE-2011-1835)\n\nA race condition flaw in mount.ecryptfs_private could allow a local\nattacker to overwrite arbitrary files. (CVE-2011-1837)\n\nA race condition flaw in the way temporary files were accessed in\nmount.ecryptfs_private could allow a malicious, local user to make\narbitrary modifications to the mtab file. (CVE-2011-3145)\n\nA race condition flaw was found in the way mount.ecryptfs_private checked\nthe permissions of the directory to mount. A local attacker could use this\nflaw to mount (and then access) a directory they would otherwise not have\naccess to. Note: The fix for this issue is incomplete until a kernel-space\nchange is made. Future Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 kernel updates\nwill correct this issue. (CVE-2011-1833)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Ubuntu Security Team for reporting these\nissues. The Ubuntu Security Team acknowledges Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall\nand Dan Rosenberg as the original reporters of CVE-2011-1831,\nCVE-2011-1832, and CVE-2011-1833; Dan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers as the\noriginal reporters of CVE-2011-1834; Marc Deslauriers as the original\nreporter of CVE-2011-1835; and Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall as the original\nreporter of CVE-2011-1837.\n\nUsers of ecryptfs-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues.",
