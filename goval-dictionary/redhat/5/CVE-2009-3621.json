    "Title": "RHSA-2009:1670: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* NULL pointer dereference flaws in the r128 driver. Checks to test if the\nConcurrent Command Engine state was initialized were missing in private\nIOCTL functions. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a local denial\nof service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the NFSv4 implementation. Several\nNFSv4 file locking functions failed to check whether a file had been opened\non the server before performing locking operations on it. A local user on a\nsystem with an NFSv4 share mounted could possibly use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-3726, Important)\n\n* a flaw in tcf_fill_node(). A certain data structure in this function was\nnot initialized properly before being copied to user-space. This could lead\nto an information leak. (CVE-2009-3612, Moderate)\n\n* unix_stream_connect() did not check if a UNIX domain socket was in the\nshutdown state. This could lead to a deadlock. A local, unprivileged user\ncould use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)\n\nKnowledgebase DOC-20536 has steps to mitigate NULL pointer dereference\nflaws.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* frequently changing a CPU between online and offline caused a kernel\npanic on some systems. (BZ#545583)\n\n* for the LSI Logic LSI53C1030 Ultra320 SCSI controller, read commands sent\ncould receive incorrect data, preventing correct data transfer. (BZ#529308)\n\n* pciehp could not detect PCI Express hot plug slots on some systems.\n(BZ#530383)\n\n* soft lockups: inotify race and contention on dcache_lock. (BZ#533822,\nBZ#537019)\n\n* priority ordered lists are now used for threads waiting for a given\nmutex. (BZ#533858)\n\n* a deadlock in DLM could cause GFS2 file systems to lock up. (BZ#533859)\n\n* use-after-free bug in the audit subsystem crashed certain systems when\nrunning usermod. (BZ#533861)\n\n* on certain hardware configurations, a kernel panic when the Broadcom\niSCSI offload driver (bnx2i.ko and cnic.ko) was loaded. (BZ#537014)\n\n* qla2xxx: Enabled MSI-X, and correctly handle the module parameter to\ncontrol it. This improves performance for certain systems. (BZ#537020)\n\n* system crash when reading the cpuaffinity file on a system. (BZ#537346)\n\n* suspend-resume problems on systems with lots of logical CPUs, e.g. BX-EX.\n(BZ#539674)\n\n* off-by-one error in the legacy PCI bus check. (BZ#539675)\n\n* TSC was not made available on systems with multi-clustered APICs. This\ncould cause slow performance for time-sensitive applications. (BZ#539676)\n\n* ACPI: ARB_DISABLE now disabled on platforms that do not need it.\n(BZ#539677)\n\n* fix node to core and power-aware scheduling issues, and a kernel panic\nduring boot on certain AMD Opteron processors. (BZ#539678, BZ#540469,\nBZ#539680, BZ#539682)\n\n* APIC timer interrupt issues on some AMD Opteron systems prevented\nachieving full power savings. (BZ#539681)\n\n* general OProfile support for some newer Intel processors. (BZ#539683)\n\n* system crash during boot when NUMA is enabled on systems using MC and\nkernel-xen. (BZ#539684)\n\n* on some larger systems, performance issues due to a spinlock. (BZ#539685)\n\n* APIC errors when IOMMU is enabled on some AMD Opteron systems.\n(BZ#539687)\n\n* on some AMD Opteron systems, repeatedly taking a CPU offline then online\ncaused a system hang. (BZ#539688)\n\n* I/O page fault errors on some systems. (BZ#539689)\n\n* certain memory configurations could cause the kernel-xen kernel to fail\nto boot on some AMD Opteron systems. (BZ#539690)\n\n* NMI watchdog is now disabled for offline CPUs. (BZ#539691)\n\n* duplicate directories in /proc/acpi/processor/ on BX-EX systems.\n(BZ#539692)\n\n* links did not come up when using bnx2x with certain Broadcom devices.\n(BZ#540381)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
