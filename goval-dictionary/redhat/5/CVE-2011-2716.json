    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0308: busybox security and bug fix update (Low)",
    "Description": "BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number\nof system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for\nrecovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those\ninvolving broken shared libraries.\n\nA buffer underflow flaw was found in the way the uncompress utility of\nBusyBox expanded certain archive files compressed using Lempel-Ziv\ncompression. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted\narchive file with uncompress, it could cause BusyBox to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nBusyBox. (CVE-2006-1168)\n\nThe BusyBox DHCP client, udhcpc, did not sufficiently sanitize certain\noptions provided in DHCP server replies, such as the client hostname. A\nmalicious DHCP server could send such an option with a specially-crafted\nvalue to a DHCP client. If this option's value was saved on the client\nsystem, and then later insecurely evaluated by a process that assumes the\noption is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the\nprivileges of that process. Note: udhcpc is not used on Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux by default, and no DHCP client script is provided with the busybox\npackages. (CVE-2011-2716)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the cp command wrongly returned the exit code 0 to\nindicate success if a device ran out of space while attempting to copy\nfiles of more than 4 gigabytes. This update modifies BusyBox, so that in\nsuch situations, the exit code 1 is returned. Now, the cp command shows\ncorrectly whether a process failed. (BZ#689659)\n\n* Prior to this update, the findfs command failed to check all existing\nblock devices on a system with thousands of block device nodes in \"/dev/\".\nThis update modifies BusyBox so that findfs checks all block devices even\nin this case. (BZ#756723)\n\nAll users of busybox are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues.",
