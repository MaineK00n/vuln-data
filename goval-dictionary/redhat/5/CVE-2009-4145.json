    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0108: NetworkManager security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "NetworkManager is a network link manager that attempts to keep a wired or\nwireless network connection active at all times.\n\nA missing network certificate verification flaw was found in\nNetworkManager. If a user created a WPA Enterprise or 802.1x wireless\nnetwork connection that was verified using a Certificate Authority (CA)\ncertificate, and then later removed that CA certificate file,\nNetworkManager failed to verify the identity of the network on the\nfollowing connection attempts. In these situations, a malicious wireless\nnetwork spoofing the original network could trick a user into disclosing\nauthentication credentials or communicating over an untrusted network.\n(CVE-2009-4144)\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in NetworkManager's\nnm-connection-editor D-Bus interface. If a user edited network connection\noptions using nm-connection-editor, a summary of those changes was\nbroadcasted over the D-Bus message bus, possibly disclosing sensitive\ninformation (such as wireless network authentication credentials) to other\nlocal users. (CVE-2009-4145)\n\nUsers of NetworkManager should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
