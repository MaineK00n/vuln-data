    "Title": "RHSA-2007:0964: openssl security update (Important)",
    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and\nTransport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength\ngeneral purpose cryptography library. Datagram TLS (DTLS) is a protocol\nbased on TLS that is capable of securing datagram transport (UDP for\ninstance). \n\nThe OpenSSL security team discovered a flaw in DTLS support.  An attacker\ncould create a malicious client or server that could trigger a heap\noverflow. This is possibly exploitable to run arbitrary code, but it has\nnot been verified  (CVE-2007-4995). Note that this flaw only affects\napplications making use of DTLS. Red Hat does not ship any DTLS client or\nserver applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nA flaw was found in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() utility function. An\nattacker could send a list of ciphers to an application that used this\nfunction and overrun a buffer with a single byte (CVE-2007-5135). Few\napplications make use of this vulnerable function and generally it is used\nonly when applications are compiled for debugging.\n\nA number of possible side-channel attacks were discovered affecting\nOpenSSL. A local attacker could possibly obtain RSA private keys being\nused on a system. In practice these attacks would be difficult to perform\noutside of a lab environment. This update contains backported patches\ndesigned to mitigate these issues.  (CVE-2007-3108).\n\nUsers of OpenSSL should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.  \n\nPlease note that the fix for the DTLS flaw involved an overhaul of the DTLS\nhandshake processing which may introduce incompatibilities if a new client\nis used with an older server.\n\nAfter installing this update, users are advised to either restart all\nservices that use OpenSSL or restart their system.",
