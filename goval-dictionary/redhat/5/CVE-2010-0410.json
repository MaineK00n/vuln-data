    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0398: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* a flaw was found in the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE)\nimplementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted ISO\nMPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) frame to a target system, resulting in an\ninfinite loop (denial of service). (CVE-2010-1086, Important)\n\n* on AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure the\nELF interpreter was available before making a call to the SET_PERSONALITY\nmacro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by\nrunning a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application.\n(CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)\n\n* a flaw was found in the kernel connector implementation. A local,\nunprivileged user could trigger this flaw by sending an arbitrary number\nof notification requests using specially-crafted netlink messages,\nresulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2010-0410, Moderate)\n\n* a flaw was found in the Memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) instruction decoder in\nthe Xen hypervisor implementation. An unprivileged guest user could use\nthis flaw to trick the hypervisor into emulating a certain instruction,\nwhich could crash the guest (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0730, Moderate)\n\n* a divide-by-zero flaw was found in the azx_position_ok() function in the\ndriver for Intel High Definition Audio, snd-hda-intel. A local,\nunprivileged user could trigger this flaw to cause a kernel crash (denial\nof service). (CVE-2010-1085, Moderate)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* in some cases, booting a system with the \"iommu=on\" kernel parameter\nresulted in a Xen hypervisor panic. (BZ#580199)\n\n* the fnic driver flushed the Rx queue instead of the Tx queue after\nfabric login. This caused crashes in some cases. (BZ#580829)\n\n* \"kernel unaligned access\" warnings were logged to the dmesg log on some\nsystems. (BZ#580832)\n\n* the \"Northbridge Error, node 1, core: -1 K8 ECC error\" error occurred on\nsome systems using the amd64_edac driver. (BZ#580836)\n\n* in rare circumstances, when using kdump and booting a kernel with\n\"crashkernel=128M@16M\", the kdump kernel did not boot after a crash.\n(BZ#580838)\n\n* TLB page table entry flushing was done incorrectly on IBM System z,\npossibly causing crashes, subtle data inconsistency, or other issues.\n(BZ#580839)\n\n* iSCSI failover times were slower than in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3.\n(BZ#580840)\n\n* fixed floating point state corruption after signal. (BZ#580841)\n\n* in certain circumstances, under heavy load, certain network interface\ncards using the bnx2 driver and configured to use MSI-X, could stop\nprocessing interrupts and then network connectivity would cease.\n(BZ#587799)\n\n* cnic parts resets could cause a deadlock when the bnx2 device was\nenslaved in a bonding device and that device had an associated VLAN.\n(BZ#581148)\n\n* some BIOS implementations initialized interrupt remapping hardware in a\nway the Xen hypervisor implementation did not expect. This could have\ncaused a system hang during boot. (BZ#581150)\n\n* AMD Magny-Cours systems panicked when booting a 32-bit kernel.\n(BZ#580846)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
