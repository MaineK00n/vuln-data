    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0651: spice-xpi security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a\nremote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing\nvirtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)\nhypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.\n\nThe spice-xpi package provides a plug-in that allows the SPICE client to\nrun from within Mozilla Firefox.\n\nA race condition was found in the way the SPICE Firefox plug-in and the\nSPICE client communicated. A local attacker could use this flaw to trick\nthe plug-in and the SPICE client into communicating over an\nattacker-controlled socket, possibly gaining access to authentication\ndetails, or resulting in a man-in-the-middle attack on the SPICE\nconnection. (CVE-2010-2792)\n\nIt was found that the SPICE Firefox plug-in used a predictable name for its\nlog file. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct a symbolic link\nattack, allowing them to overwrite arbitrary files accessible to the user\nrunning Firefox. (CVE-2010-2794)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* a bug prevented users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5, with all updates\napplied, from running the SPICE Firefox plug-in when using Firefox 3.6.4.\nWith this update, the plug-in works correctly with Firefox 3.6.4 and the\nlatest version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5, Firefox 3.6.7. (BZ#618244)\n\n* unused code has been removed during source code refactoring. This also\nresolves a bug in the SPICE Firefox plug-in that caused it to close random\nfile descriptors. (BZ#594006, BZ#619067)\n\nNote: This update should be installed together with the RHSA-2010:0632\nqspice-client update: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0632.html\n\nUsers of spice-xpi should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the update,\nFirefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.",
