    "Description": "Piranha provides high-availability and load-balancing services for Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux. The piranha packages contain various tools to administer\nand configure the Linux Virtual Server (LVS), as well as the heartbeat and\nfailover components. LVS is a dynamically-adjusted kernel routing mechanism\nthat provides load balancing, primarily for Web and FTP servers.\n\nIt was discovered that the Piranha Configuration Tool did not properly\nrestrict access to its web pages. A remote attacker able to connect to the\nPiranha Configuration Tool web server port could use this flaw to read or\nmodify the LVS configuration without providing valid administrative\ncredentials. (CVE-2013-6492)\n\nAll piranha users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue.",
