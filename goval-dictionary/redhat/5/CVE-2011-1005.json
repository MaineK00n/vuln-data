    "Title": "RHSA-2011:0909: ruby security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It\nhas features to process text files and to do system management tasks.\n\nA flaw was found in the way large amounts of memory were allocated on\n64-bit systems when using the BigDecimal class. A context-dependent\nattacker could use this flaw to cause memory corruption, causing a Ruby\napplication that uses the BigDecimal class to crash or, possibly, execute\narbitrary code. This issue did not affect 32-bit systems. (CVE-2011-0188)\n\nA race condition flaw was found in the remove system entries method in the\nFileUtils module. If a local user ran a Ruby script that uses this method,\na local attacker could use this flaw to delete arbitrary files and\ndirectories accessible to that user via a symbolic link attack.\n(CVE-2011-1004)\n\nIt was found that WEBrick (the Ruby HTTP server toolkit) did not filter\nterminal escape sequences from its log files. A remote attacker could use\nspecially-crafted HTTP requests to inject terminal escape sequences into\nthe WEBrick log files. If a victim viewed the log files with a terminal\nemulator, it could result in control characters being executed with the\nprivileges of that user. (CVE-2009-4492)\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way WEBrick displayed\nerror pages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a cross-site\nscripting attack against victims by tricking them into visiting a\nspecially-crafted URL. (CVE-2010-0541)\n\nA flaw was found in the method for translating an exception message into a\nstring in the Exception class. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nbypass safe level 4 restrictions, allowing untrusted (tainted) code to\nmodify arbitrary, trusted (untainted) strings, which safe level 4\nrestrictions would otherwise prevent. (CVE-2011-1005)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of Apple Product Security for\nreporting the CVE-2011-0188 and CVE-2010-0541 issues.\n\nAll Ruby users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.",
