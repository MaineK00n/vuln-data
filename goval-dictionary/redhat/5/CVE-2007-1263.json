    "Description": "GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.\n\nGerardo Richarte discovered that a number of applications that make use of\nGnuPG are prone to a vulnerability involving incorrect verification of\nsignatures and encryption.  An attacker could add arbitrary content to a\nsigned message in such a way that a receiver of the message would not be\nable to distinguish between the properly signed parts of a message and the\nforged, unsigned, parts.  (CVE-2007-1263)\n\nWhilst this is not a vulnerability in GnuPG itself, the GnuPG team have\nproduced a patch to protect against messages with multiple plaintext\npackets.  Users should update to these erratum packages which contain the\nbackported patch for this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Core Security Technologies for reporting this\nissue.",
