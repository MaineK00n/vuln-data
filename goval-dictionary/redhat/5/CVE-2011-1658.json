    "Title": "RHSA-2011:0412: glibc security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple\nprograms on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the\nstandard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot\nfunction properly.\n\nThe fix for CVE-2010-3847 introduced a regression in the way the dynamic\nloader expanded the $ORIGIN dynamic string token specified in the RPATH and\nRUNPATH entries in the ELF library header. A local attacker could use this\nflaw to escalate their privileges via a setuid or setgid program using\nsuch a library. (CVE-2011-0536)\n\nIt was discovered that the glibc addmntent() function did not sanitize its\ninput properly. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject\nmalformed lines into /etc/mtab via certain setuid mount helpers, if the\nattacker were allowed to mount to an arbitrary directory under their\ncontrol. (CVE-2010-0296)\n\nIt was discovered that the glibc fnmatch() function did not properly\nrestrict the use of alloca(). If the function was called on sufficiently\nlarge inputs, it could cause an application using fnmatch() to crash or,\npossibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.\n(CVE-2011-1071)\n\nIt was discovered that the locale command did not produce properly escaped\noutput as required by the POSIX specification. If an attacker were able to\nset the locale environment variables in the environment of a script that\nperformed shell evaluation on the output of the locale command, and that\nscript were run with different privileges than the attacker's, it could\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the script. (CVE-2011-1095)\n\nAll users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.",
