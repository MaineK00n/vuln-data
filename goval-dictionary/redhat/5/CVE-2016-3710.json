    "Title": "RHSA-2016:1943: kvm security update (Important)",
    "Description": "KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware. Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the way QEMU's VGA emulation with VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) support performed read/write operations using I/O port methods. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the host's QEMU process. (CVE-2016-3710)\n\n* Quick Emulator(QEMU) built with the virtio framework is vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue. It was found that a malicious guest user could submit more requests than the virtqueue size permits. Processing a request allocates a VirtQueueElement results in unbounded memory allocation on the host controlled by the guest. (CVE-2016-5403)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Wei Xiao (360 Marvel Team) and Qinghao Tang (360 Marvel Team) for reporting CVE-2016-3710 and hongzhenhao (Marvel Team) for reporting CVE-2016-5403.",
