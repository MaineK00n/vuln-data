    "Title": "RHSA-2013:0121: mysql security and bug fix update (Low)",
    "Description": "MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of\nthe MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.\n\nIt was found that the fix for the CVE-2009-4030 issue, a flaw in the way\nMySQL checked the paths used as arguments for the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX\nDIRECTORY directives when the \"datadir\" option was configured with a\nrelative path, was incorrectly removed when the mysql packages in Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5 were updated to version 5.0.95 via RHSA-2012:0127. An\nauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to bypass the restriction\npreventing the use of subdirectories of the MySQL data directory being used\nas DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY paths. This update re-applies the fix\nfor CVE-2009-4030. (CVE-2012-4452)\n\nNote: If the use of the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives were\ndisabled as described in RHSA-2010:0109 (by adding \"symbolic-links=0\" to\nthe \"[mysqld]\" section of the \"my.cnf\" configuration file), users were not\nvulnerable to this issue.\n\nThis issue was discovered by Karel Voln√Ω of the Red Hat Quality Engineering\nteam.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the log file path in the logrotate script did not\nbehave as expected. As a consequence, the logrotate function failed to\nrotate the \"/var/log/mysqld.log\" file. This update modifies the logrotate\nscript to allow rotating the mysqld.log file. (BZ#647223)\n\n* Prior to this update, the mysqld daemon could fail when using the EXPLAIN\nflag in prepared statement mode. This update modifies the underlying code\nto handle the EXPLAIN flag as expected. (BZ#654000)\n\n* Prior to this update, the mysqld init script could wrongly report that\nmysql server startup failed when the server was actually started. This\nupdate modifies the init script to report the status of the mysqld server\nas expected. (BZ#703476)\n\n* Prior to this update, the \"--enable-profiling\" option was by default\ndisabled. This update enables the profiling feature. (BZ#806365)\n\nAll MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this\nupdate, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.",
