    "Description": "The gfs2-utils package provides the user-space tools necessary to mount,\ncreate, maintain, and test GFS2 file systems.\n\nMultiple insecure temporary file use flaws were discovered in GFS2 user\nlevel utilities. A local attacker could use these flaws to overwrite an\narbitrary file writable by a victim running those utilities (typically\nroot) with the output of the utilities via a symbolic link attack.\n(CVE-2008-6552)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* gfs2_fsck now properly detects and repairs problems with sequence numbers\non GFS2 file systems.\n\n* GFS2 user utilities now use the file system UUID.\n\n* gfs2_grow now properly updates the file system size during operation.\n\n* gfs2_fsck now returns the proper exit codes.\n\n* gfs2_convert now properly frees blocks when removing free blocks up to\nheight 2.\n\n* the gfs2_fsck manual page has been renamed to fsck.gfs2 to match current\nstandards.\n\n* the 'gfs2_tool df' command now provides human-readable output.\n\n* mounting GFS2 file systems with the noatime or noquota option now works\nproperly.\n\n* new capabilities have been added to the gfs2_edit tool to help in testing\nand debugging GFS and GFS2 issues.\n\n* the 'gfs2_tool df' command no longer segfaults on file systems with a\nblock size other than 4k.\n\n* the gfs2_grow manual page no longer references the '-r' option, which has\nbeen removed.\n\n* the 'gfs2_tool unfreeze' command no longer hangs during use.\n\n* gfs2_convert no longer corrupts file systems when converting from GFS to\nGFS2.\n\n* gfs2_fsck no longer segfaults when encountering a block which is listed\nas both a data and stuffed directory inode.\n\n* gfs2_fsck can now fix file systems even if the journal is already locked\nfor use.\n\n* a GFS2 file system's metadata is now properly copied with 'gfs2_edit\nsavemeta' and 'gfs2_edit restoremeta'.\n\n* the gfs2_edit savemeta function now properly saves blocks of type 2.\n\n* 'gfs2_convert -vy' now works properly on the PowerPC architecture.\n\n* when mounting a GFS2 file system as '/', mount_gfs2 no longer fails after\nbeing unable to find the file system in '/proc/mounts'.\n\n* gfs2_fsck no longer segfaults when fixing 'EA leaf block type' problems.\n\nAll gfs2-utils users should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves\nthese issues.",

    "Description": "The rgmanager package contains the Red Hat Resource Group Manager, which\nprovides high availability for critical server applications in the event of\nsystem downtime.\n\nMultiple insecure temporary file use flaws were discovered in rgmanager and\nvarious resource scripts run by rgmanager.

(CVE-2008-6552)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* clulog now accepts '-' as the first character in messages.\n\n* if expire_time is 0, max_restarts is no longer ignored.\n\n* the SAP resource agents included in the rgmanager package shipped with\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 were outdated. This update includes the most\nrecent SAP resource agents and, consequently, improves SAP failover\nsupport.\n\n* empty PID files no longer cause resource start failures.\n\n* recovery policy of type 'restart' now works properly when using a\nresource based on ra-skelet.sh.\n\n* samba.sh has been updated to kill the PID listed in the proper PID file.\n\n* handling of the '-F' option has been improved to fix issues causing\nrgmanager to crash if no members of a restricted failover domain were\nonline.\n\n* the number of simultaneous status checks can now be limited to prevent\nload spikes.\n\n* forking and cloning during status checks has been optimized to reduce\nload spikes.\n\n* rg_test no longer hangs when run with large cluster configuration files.\n\n* when rgmanager is used with a restricted failover domain it will no\nlonger occasionally segfault when some nodes are offline during a failover\nevent.\n\n* virtual machine guests no longer restart after a cluster.conf update.\n\n* nfsclient.sh no longer leaves temporary files after running.\n\n* extra checks from the Oracle agents have been removed.\n\n* vm.sh now uses libvirt.\n\n* users can now define an explicit service processing order when\ncentral_processing is enabled.\n\n* virtual machine guests can no longer start on 2 nodes at the same time.\n\n* in some cases a successfully migrated virtual machine guest could restart\nwhen the cluster.conf file was updated.\n\n* incorrect reporting of a service being started when it was not started\nhas been addressed.\n\nAs well, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* a startup_wait option has been added to the MySQL resource agent.\n\n* services can now be prioritized.\n\n* rgmanager now checks to see if it has been killed by the OOM killer and\nif so, reboots the node.\n\nUsers of rgmanager are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues and adds these enhancements.",

(CVE-2008-4579,\nCVE-2008-6552)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* a buffer could overflow if cluster.conf had more than 52 entries per\nblock inside the \u003ccman\u003e block.

It\nis also now possible to specify a different timeout value with the '-t'\noption.\n\n* the IPMI fencing agent now allows punctuation in passwords.\n\n* quickly starting and stopping the cman service no longer causes the\ncluster membership to become inconsistent across the cluster.\n\n* an issue with lock syncing caused 'receive_own from' errors to be logged\nto '/var/log/messages'.\n\n* an issue which caused gfs_controld to segfault when mounting hundreds of\nfile systems has been fixed.\n\n* the LPAR fencing agent now properly reports status when an LPAR is in\nOpen Firmware mode.\n\n* the LPAR fencing agent now works properly with systems using the\nIntegrated Virtualization Manager (IVM).\n\n* the APC SNMP fencing agent now properly recognizes outletStatusOn and\noutletStatusOff return codes from the SNMP agent.\n\n* the WTI fencing agent can now connect to fencing devices with no\npassword.\n\n* the rps-10 fencing agent now properly performs a reboot when run with no\noptions.\n\n* the IPMI fencing agent now supports different cipher types with the '-C'\noption.\n\n* qdisk now properly scans devices and partitions.\n\n* cman now checks to see if a new node has state to prevent killing the\nfirst node during cluster setup.\n\n* 'service qdiskd start' now works properly.\n\n* the McData fence agent now works properly with the McData Sphereon 4500\nFabric Switch.\n\n* the Egenera fence agent can now specify an SSH login name.\n\n* the APC fence agent now works with non-admin accounts when using the\n3.5.x firmware.\n\n* fence_xvmd now tries two methods to reboot a virtual machine.\n\n* connections to OpenAIS are now allowed from unprivileged CPG clients with\nthe user and group of 'ais'.\n\n* groupd no longer allows the default fence domain to be '0', which\npreviously caused rgmanager to hang. Now, rgmanager no longer hangs.\n\n* the RSA fence agent now supports SSH enabled RSA II devices.\n\n* the DRAC fence agent now works with the Integrated Dell Remote Access\nController (iDRAC) on Dell PowerEdge M600 blade servers.\n\n* fixed a memory leak in cman.\n\n* qdisk now displays a warning if more than one label is found with the\nsame name.\n\n* the DRAC5 fencing agent now shows proper usage instructions for the '-D'\noption.\n\n* cman no longer uses the wrong node name when getnameinfo() fails.\n\n* the SCSI fence agent now verifies that sg_persist is installed.\n\n* the DRAC5 fencing agent now properly handles modulename.\n\n* QDisk now logs warning messages if it appears its I/O to shared storage\nis hung.\n\n* fence_apc no longer fails with a pexpect exception.\n\n* removing a node from the cluster using 'cman_tool leave remove' now\nproperly reduces the expected_votes and quorum.\n\n* a semaphore leak in cman has been fixed.\n\n* 'cman_tool nodes -F name' no longer segfaults when a node is out of\nmembership.\n\nEnhancements:\n\n* support for: ePowerSwitch 8+ and LPAR/HMC v3 devices, Cisco MDS 9124 and\nMDS 9134 SAN switches, the virsh fencing agent, and broadcast communication\nwith cman.\n\n* fence_scsi limitations added to fence_scsi man page.\n\nUsers of cman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues and add these enhancements.",
