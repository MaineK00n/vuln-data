    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0458: perl security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system\nadministration utilities and web programming. The Safe extension module\nallows users to compile and execute Perl code in restricted compartments.\nThe File::Path module allows users to create and remove directory trees.\n\nThe Safe module did not properly restrict the code of implicitly called\nmethods (such as DESTROY and AUTOLOAD) on implicitly blessed objects\nreturned as a result of unsafe code evaluation. These methods could have\nbeen executed unrestricted by Safe when such objects were accessed or\ndestroyed. A specially-crafted Perl script executed inside of a Safe\ncompartment could use this flaw to bypass intended Safe module\nrestrictions. (CVE-2010-1168)\n\nThe Safe module did not properly restrict code compiled in a Safe\ncompartment and executed out of the compartment via a subroutine reference\nreturned as a result of unsafe code evaluation. A specially-crafted Perl\nscript executed inside of a Safe compartment could use this flaw to bypass\nintended Safe module restrictions, if the returned subroutine reference was\ncalled from outside of the compartment. (CVE-2010-1447)\n\nMultiple race conditions were found in the way the File::Path module's\nrmtree function removed directory trees. A malicious, local user with write\naccess to a directory being removed by a victim, running a Perl script\nusing rmtree, could cause the permissions of arbitrary files to be changed\nto world-writable and setuid, or delete arbitrary files via a symbolic link\nattack, if the victim had the privileges to change the permissions of the\ntarget files or to remove them. (CVE-2008-5302, CVE-2008-5303)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tim Bunce for responsibly reporting the\nCVE-2010-1168 and CVE-2010-1447 issues. Upstream acknowledges Nick Cleaton\nas the original reporter of CVE-2010-1168, and Tim Bunce and RafaÃ«l\nGarcia-Suarez as the original reporters of CVE-2010-1447.\n\nThese packages upgrade the Safe extension module to version 2.27. Refer to\nthe Safe module's Changes file, linked to in the References, for a full\nlist of changes.\n\nUsers of perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues. All applications using the Safe or File::Path modules\nmust be restarted for this update to take effect.",
