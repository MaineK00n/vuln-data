    "Title": "RHSA-2012:1201: tetex security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of\nformatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice\nIndependent (DVI) file as output.\n\nteTeX embeds a copy of t1lib to rasterize bitmaps from PostScript Type 1\nfonts. The following issues affect t1lib code:\n\nTwo heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way t1lib processed\nAdobe Font Metrics (AFM) files. If a specially-crafted font file was opened\nby teTeX, it could cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2010-2642,\nCVE-2011-0433)\n\nAn invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted\nfont file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running teTeX.\n(CVE-2011-0764)\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file\ncould, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1553)\n\nAn off-by-one flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file could,\nwhen opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1554)\n\nAn out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted\nfont file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash. (CVE-2011-1552)\n\nteTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)\nfile viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF\ndocuments. The following issues affect Xpdf code:\n\nAn uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in Xpdf. If pdflatex was\nused to process a TeX document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it\ncould cause pdflatex to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3702)\n\nAn array index error was found in the way Xpdf parsed PostScript Type 1\nfonts embedded in PDF documents. If pdflatex was used to process a TeX\ndocument referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it could cause pdflatex\nto crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3704)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting\nCVE-2010-2642. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the\noriginal reporter of CVE-2010-2642.\n\nAll users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
