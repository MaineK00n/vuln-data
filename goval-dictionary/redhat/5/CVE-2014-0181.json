    "Title": "RHSA-2014:1959: kernel security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the permission checks performed by the Linux kernel\nwhen a netlink message was received were not sufficient. A local,\nunprivileged user could potentially bypass these restrictions by passing a\nnetlink socket as stdout or stderr to a more privileged process and\naltering the output of this process. (CVE-2014-0181, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Andy Lutomirski for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the kernel did not successfully deliver multicast packets\nwhen the multicast querier was disabled. Consequently, the corosync utility\nterminated unexpectedly and the affected storage node did not join its\nintended cluster. With this update, multicast packets are delivered\nproperly when the multicast querier is disabled, and corosync handles the\nnode as expected. (BZ#902454)\n\n* Previously, the kernel wrote the metadata contained in all system\ninformation blocks on a single page of the /proc/sysinfo file. However,\nwhen the machine configuration was very extensive and the data did not fit\non a single page, the system overwrote random memory regions, which in turn\ncaused data corruption when reading the /proc/sysconf file. With this\nupdate, /proc/sysinfo automatically allocates a larger buffer if the data\noutput does not fit the current buffer, which prevents the data corruption.\n(BZ#1131283)\n\n* Prior to this update, the it_real_fn() function did not, in certain\ncases, successfully acquire the SIGLOCK signal when the do_setitimer()\nfunction used the ITIMER_REAL timer. As a consequence, the current process\nentered an endless loop and became unresponsive. This update fixes the bug\nand it_real_fn() no longer causes the kernel to become unresponsive.\n(BZ#1134654)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
