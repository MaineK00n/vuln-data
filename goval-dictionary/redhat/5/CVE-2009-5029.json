    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0126: glibc security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple\nprograms on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the\nstandard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot\nfunction properly.\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the way the glibc library read timezone files. If a\ncarefully-crafted timezone file was loaded by an application linked against\nglibc, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n(CVE-2009-5029)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the ldd utility identified dynamically linked\nlibraries. If an attacker could trick a user into running ldd on a\nmalicious binary, it could result in arbitrary code execution with the\nprivileges of the user running ldd. (CVE-2009-5064)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the way the glibc library loaded ELF (Executable and Linking\nFormat) files. If a carefully-crafted ELF file was loaded by an\napplication linked against glibc, it could cause the application to crash\nor, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning the application. (CVE-2010-0830)\n\nIt was found that the glibc addmntent() function, used by various mount\nhelper utilities, did not handle certain errors correctly when updating the\nmtab (mounted file systems table) file. If such utilities had the setuid\nbit set, a local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file.\n(CVE-2011-1089)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the remote procedure call (RPC)\nimplementation in glibc. A remote attacker able to open a large number of\nconnections to an RPC service that is using the RPC implementation from\nglibc, could use this flaw to make that service use an excessive amount of\nCPU time. (CVE-2011-4609)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Ubuntu Security Team for reporting\nCVE-2010-0830, and Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-1089. The Ubuntu\nSecurity Team acknowledges Dan Rosenberg as the original reporter of\nCVE-2010-0830.\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues.",
