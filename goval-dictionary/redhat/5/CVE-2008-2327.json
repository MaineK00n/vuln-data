    "Title": "RHSA-2008:0847: libtiff security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged\nImage File Format (TIFF) files.\n\nMultiple uses of uninitialized values were discovered in libtiff's\nLempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm decoder. An attacker could\ncreate a carefully crafted LZW-encoded TIFF file that would cause an\napplication linked with libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2008-2327)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of the Apple Product Security team for\nreporting this issue.\n\nAdditionally, these updated packages fix the following bug:\n\n* the libtiff packages included manual pages for the sgi2tiff and tiffsv\ncommands, which are not included in these packages. These extraneous manual\npages were removed.\n\nAll libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.",
