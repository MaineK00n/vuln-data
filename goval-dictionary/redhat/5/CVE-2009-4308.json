    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0147: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function\nin the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\nimplementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP\npacket to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2010-0008, Important)\n\n* a missing boundary check was found in the do_move_pages() function in the\nmemory migration functionality in the Linux kernel. A local user could use\nthis flaw to cause a local denial of service or an information leak.\n(CVE-2010-0415, Important)\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ip6_dst_lookup_tail()\nfunction in the Linux kernel. An attacker on the local network could\ntrigger this flaw by sending IPv6 traffic to a target system, leading to a\nsystem crash (kernel OOPS) if dst-\u003eneighbour is NULL on the target system\nwhen receiving an IPv6 packet. (CVE-2010-0437, Important)\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ext4 file system code in\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to trigger a local\ndenial of service by mounting a specially-crafted, journal-less ext4 file\nsystem, if that file system forced an EROFS error. (CVE-2009-4308,\nModerate)\n\n* an information leak was found in the print_fatal_signal() implementation\nin the Linux kernel. When \"/proc/sys/kernel/print-fatal-signals\" is set to\n1 (the default value is 0), memory that is reachable by the kernel could be\nleaked to user-space. This issue could also result in a system crash. Note\nthat this flaw only affected the i386 architecture. (CVE-2010-0003,\nModerate)\n\n* missing capability checks were found in the ebtables implementation, used\nfor creating an Ethernet bridge firewall. This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to bypass intended capability restrictions and modify\nebtables rules. (CVE-2010-0007, Low)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* a bug prevented Wake on LAN (WoL) being enabled on certain Intel\nhardware. (BZ#543449)\n\n* a race issue in the Journaling Block Device. (BZ#553132)\n\n* 32-bit x86 timespec structures are not the same size as on 64-bit\nsystems. A 32-bit compatible function -- sys32_sched_rr_get_interval() --\nis available. However, when 32-bit programs running on 64-bit systems\ncalled sched_rr_get_interval(), it was not called and the kernel wrote data\npast the allocated space, causing user stack corruption.\nsys32_sched_rr_get_interval() is now called as expected. (BZ#557684)\n\n* the RHSA-2010:0019 update introduced a regression, preventing WoL from\nworking for network devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#559335)\n\n* adding a bonding interface in mode balance-alb to a bridge was not\nfunctional. (BZ#560588)\n\n* some KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) guests experienced slow\nperformance (and possibly a crash) after suspend/resume. (BZ#560640)\n\n* on some systems, VF cannot be enabled in dom0. (BZ#560665)\n\n* on systems with certain network cards, a system crash occurred after\nenabling GRO. (BZ#561417)\n\n* for x86 KVM guests with pvclock enabled, the boot clocks were registered\ntwice, possibly causing KVM to write data to a random memory area during\nthe guest's life. (BZ#561454)\n\n* serious performance degradation for 32-bit applications, that map (mmap)\nthousands of small files, when run on a 64-bit system. (BZ#562746)\n\n* improved kexec/kdump handling. Previously, on some systems under heavy\nload, kexec/kdump was not functional. (BZ#562772)\n\n* dom0 was unable to boot when using the Xen hypervisor on a system with a\nlarge number of logical CPUs. (BZ#562777)\n\n* a fix for a bug that could potentially cause file system corruption.\n(BZ#564281)\n\n* a bug caused infrequent cluster issues for users of GFS2. (BZ#564288)\n\n* gfs2_delete_inode failed on read-only file systems. (BZ#564290)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
