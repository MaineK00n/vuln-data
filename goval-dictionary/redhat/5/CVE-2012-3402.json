    "Description": "The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and\nediting program.\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,\nwere found in the GIMP's Adobe Photoshop (PSD) image file plug-in. An\nattacker could create a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened,\ncould cause the PSD plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-3909,\nCVE-2012-3402)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the GIMP's GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could create a\nspecially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could cause the GIF\nplug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3481)\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)\ndecompression algorithm implementation used by the GIMP's GIF image format\nplug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted GIF image file that,\nwhen opened, could cause the GIF plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP.\n(CVE-2011-2896)\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's KiSS CEL file\nformat plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted KiSS palette\nfile that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nthe GIMP. (CVE-2012-3403)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Secunia Research for reporting CVE-2009-3909,\nand Matthias Weckbecker of the SUSE Security Team for reporting\nCVE-2012-3481.\n\nUsers of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be\nrestarted for the update to take effect.",
