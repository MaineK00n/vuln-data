    "Title": "RHSA-2014:0247: gnutls security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for\nprotocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n\nIt was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors that\ncould occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate, causing it to\nincorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker could use this\nflaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by\nGnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker. (CVE-2014-0092)\n\nA flaw was found in the way GnuTLS handled version 1 X.509 certificates.\nAn attacker able to obtain a version 1 certificate from a trusted\ncertificate authority could use this flaw to issue certificates for other\nsites that would be accepted by GnuTLS as valid. (CVE-2009-5138)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0092 issue was discovered by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of the\nRed Hat Security Technologies Team.\n\nUsers of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications\nlinked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted.",
