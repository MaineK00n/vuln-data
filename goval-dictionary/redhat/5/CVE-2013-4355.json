    "Title": "RHSA-2013:1790: kernel security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Xen hypervisor handled\nerror conditions when reading guest memory during certain guest-originated\noperations, such as port or memory mapped I/O writes. A privileged user in\na fully-virtualized guest could use this flaw to leak hypervisor stack\nmemory to a guest. (CVE-2013-4355, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* A previous fix to the kernel did not contain a memory barrier in the\npercpu_up_write() function. Consequently, under certain circumstances, a\nrace condition could occur leading to memory corruption and a subsequent\nkernel panic. This update introduces a new memory barrier pair, light_mb()\nand heavy_mb(), for per-CPU basis read and write semaphores\n(percpu-rw-semaphores) ensuring that the race condition can no longer\noccur. In addition, the read path performance of \"percpu-rw-semaphores\" has\nbeen improved. (BZ#1014715)\n\n* Due to a bug in the tg3 driver, systems that had the Wake-on-LAN (WOL)\nfeature enabled on their NICs could not have been woken up from suspension\nor hibernation using WOL. A missing pci_wake_from_d3() function call has\nbeen added to the tg3 driver, which ensures that WOL functions properly by\nsetting the PME_ENABLE bit. (BZ#1014973)\n\n* Due to an incorrect test condition in the mpt2sas driver, the driver was\nunable to catch failures to map a SCSI scatter-gather list. The test\ncondition has been corrected so that the mpt2sas driver now handles SCSI\nscatter-gather mapping failures as expected. (BZ#1018458)\n\n* A previous patch to the kernel introduced the \"VLAN tag re-insertion\"\nworkaround to resolve a problem with incorrectly handled VLAN-tagged\npackets with no assigned VLAN group while the be2net driver was in\npromiscuous mode. However, this solution led to packet corruption and a\nsubsequent kernel oops if such a processed packed was a GRO packet.\nTherefore, a patch has been applied to restrict VLAN tag re-insertion only\nto non-GRO packets. The be2net driver now processes VLAN-tagged packets\nwith no assigned VLAN group correctly in this situation. (BZ#1023348)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
