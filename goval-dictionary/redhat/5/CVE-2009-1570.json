    "Title": "RHSA-2011:0838: gimp security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and\nediting program.\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the GIMP's Microsoft Windows Bitmap (BMP) and Personal Computer\neXchange (PCX) image file plug-ins. An attacker could create a\nspecially-crafted BMP or PCX image file that, when opened, could cause the\nrelevant plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-1570, CVE-2011-1178)\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's Paint Shop Pro\n(PSP) image file plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PSP\nimage file that, when opened, could cause the PSP plug-in to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nthe GIMP. (CVE-2010-4543)\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's Lightning,\nSphere Designer, and Gfig image filters. An attacker could create a\nspecially-crafted Lightning, Sphere Designer, or Gfig filter configuration\nfile that, when opened, could cause the relevant plug-in to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nthe GIMP. (CVE-2010-4540, CVE-2010-4541, CVE-2010-4542)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research for\nresponsibly reporting the CVE-2009-1570 flaw.\n\nUsers of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be\nrestarted for the update to take effect.",
