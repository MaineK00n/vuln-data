    "Description": "The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer\nfor UNIX(R) operating systems.\n\nA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in a CUPS administration interface\nCGI script. A local attacker able to connect to the IPP port (TCP port 631)\ncould send a malicious request causing the script to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code as the \"lp\" user. Please note: the default CUPS\nconfiguration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 does not allow remote\nconnections to the IPP TCP port. (CVE-2008-0047)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank \"regenrecht\" for reporting this issue.\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of CUPS as shipped with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 3 or 4.\n\nTwo overflows were discovered in the HP-GL/2-to-PostScript filter. An\nattacker could create a malicious HP-GL/2 file that could possibly execute\narbitrary code as the \"lp\" user if the file is printed. (CVE-2008-0053)\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the GIF decoding routines used by\nCUPS image converting filters \"imagetops\" and \"imagetoraster\". An attacker\ncould create a malicious GIF file that could possibly execute arbitrary\ncode as the \"lp\" user if the file was printed. (CVE-2008-1373)\n\nAll cups users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.",
