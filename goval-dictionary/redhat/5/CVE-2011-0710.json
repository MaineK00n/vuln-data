    "Title": "RHSA-2011:0429: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* A missing boundary check was found in the dvb_ca_ioctl() function in the\nLinux kernel's av7110 module. On systems that use old DVB cards that\nrequire the av7110 module, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw\nto cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2011-0521,\nImportant)\n\n* An inconsistency was found in the interaction between the Linux kernel's\nmethod for allocating NFSv4 (Network File System version 4) ACL data and\nthe method by which it was freed. This inconsistency led to a kernel panic\nwhich could be triggered by a local, unprivileged user with files owned by\nsaid user on an NFSv4 share. (CVE-2011-1090, Moderate)\n\n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Generic Receive Offload\n(GRO) functionality in the Linux kernel's networking implementation. If\nboth GRO and promiscuous mode were enabled on an interface in a virtual LAN\n(VLAN), it could result in a denial of service when a malformed VLAN frame\nis received on that interface. (CVE-2011-1478, Moderate)\n\n* A missing security check in the Linux kernel's implementation of the\ninstall_special_mapping() function could allow a local, unprivileged user\nto bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism. (CVE-2010-4346, Low)\n\n* An information leak was found in the Linux kernel's task_show_regs()\nimplementation. On IBM S/390 systems, a local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to read /proc/[PID]/status files, allowing them to discover the\nCPU register values of processes. (CVE-2011-0710, Low)\n\n* A missing validation check was found in the Linux kernel's\nmac_partition() implementation, used for supporting file systems created\non Mac OS operating systems. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause\na denial of service by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted\npartitions. (CVE-2011-1010, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ryan Sweat for reporting CVE-2011-1478; Tavis\nOrmandy for reporting CVE-2010-4346; and Timo Warns for reporting\nCVE-2011-1010.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will\nbe available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the\nReferences section.\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical\nNotes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.",
