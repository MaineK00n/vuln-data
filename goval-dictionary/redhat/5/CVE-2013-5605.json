    "Title": "RHSA-2013:1791: nss and nspr security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Important)",
    "Description": "Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support\nthe cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server\napplications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform\nindependence for non-GUI operating system facilities.\n\nA flaw was found in the way NSS handled invalid handshake packets. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to cause a TLS/SSL client using NSS to crash\nor, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning the application. (CVE-2013-5605)\n\nIt was found that the fix for CVE-2013-1620 released via RHSA-2013:1135\nintroduced a regression causing NSS to read uninitialized data when a\ndecryption failure occurred. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause\na TLS/SSL server using NSS to crash. (CVE-2013-1739)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was discovered in both NSS and NSPR's\nimplementation of certification parsing on 64-bit systems. A remote\nattacker could use these flaws to cause an application using NSS or NSPR to\ncrash. (CVE-2013-1741, CVE-2013-5607)\n\nIt was discovered that NSS did not reject certificates with incompatible\nkey usage constraints when validating them while the verifyLog feature was\nenabled. An application using the NSS certificate validation API could\naccept an invalid certificate. (CVE-2013-5606)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting\nCVE-2013-1741, CVE-2013-5606, and CVE-2013-5607. Upstream acknowledges\nTavis Ormandy as the original reporter of CVE-2013-1741, Camilo Viecco as\nthe original reporter of CVE-2013-5606, and Pascal Cuoq, Kamil Dudka, and\nWan-Teh Chang as the original reporters of CVE-2013-5607.\n\nIn addition, the nss package has been upgraded to upstream version 3.15.3,\nand the nspr package has been upgraded to upstream version 4.10.2.\nThese updates provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious versions. (BZ#1033478, BZ#1020520)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* The RHBA-2013:1318 update introduced a regression that prevented the use\nof certificates that have an MD5 signature. This update fixes this\nregression and certificates that have an MD5 signature are once again\nsupported. To prevent the use of certificates that have an MD5 signature,\nset the \"NSS_HASH_ALG_SUPPORT\" environment variable to \"-MD5\". (BZ#1033499)\n\nUsers of NSS and NSPR are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich fix these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this\nupdate, applications using NSS or NSPR must be restarted for this update to\ntake effect.",
