    "Title": "RHSA-2013:0123: OpenIPMI security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Low)",
    "Description": "The OpenIPMI packages provide command line tools and utilities to access\nplatform information using Intelligent Platform Management Interface\n(IPMI). System administrators can use OpenIPMI to manage systems and to\nperform system health monitoring.\n\nIt was discovered that the IPMI event daemon (ipmievd) created its process\nID (PID) file with world-writable permissions. A local user could use this\nflaw to make the ipmievd init script kill an arbitrary process when the\nipmievd daemon is stopped or restarted. (CVE-2011-4339)\n\nNote: This issue did not affect the default configuration of OpenIPMI as\nshipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the ipmitool utility first checked the IPMI\nhardware for Dell IPMI extensions and listed only supported commands when\nprinting command usage like the option \"ipmtool delloem help\". On a\nnon-Dell platform, the usage text was incomplete and misleading. This\nupdate lists all Dell OEM extensions in usage texts on all platforms, which\nallows users to check for command line arguments on non-Dell hardware.\n(BZ#658762)\n\n* Prior to this update, the ipmitool utility tried to retrieve the Sensor\nData Records (SDR) from the IPMI bus instead of the Baseboard Management\nController (BMC) bus when IPMI-enabled devices reported SDR under a\ndifferent owner than the BMC. As a consequence, the timeout setting for the\nSDR read attempt could significantly decrease the performance and no sensor\ndata was shown. This update modifies ipmitool to read these SDR records\nfrom the BMC and shows the correct sensor data on these platforms.\n(BZ#671059, BZ#749796)\n\n* Prior to this update, the exit code of the \"ipmitool -o list\" option was\nnot set correctly. As a consequence, \"ipmitool -o list\" always returned the\nvalue 1 instead of the expected value 0. This update modifies the\nunderlying code to return the value 0 as expected. (BZ#740780)\n\n* Prior to this update, the \"ipmi\" service init script did not specify the\nfull path to the \"/sbin/lsmod\" and \"/sbin/modprobe\" system utilities. As a\nconsequence, the init script failed when it was executed if PATH did not\npoint to /sbin, for example, when running \"sudo /etc/init.d/ipmi\". This\nupdate modifies the init script so that it now contains the full path to\nlsmod and modrpobe. Now, it can be executed with sudo. (BZ#829705)\n\n* Prior to this update, the ipmitool man page did not list the \"-b\", \"-B\",\n\"-l\" and \"-T\" options. In this update, these options are documented in the\nipmitool man page. (BZ#846596)\n\nThis update also adds the following enhancement:\n\n* Updates to the Dell-specific IPMI extension: A new vFlash command, which\nallows users to display information about extended SD cards; a new setled\ncommand, which allows users to display the backplane LED status; improved\nerror descriptions; added support for new hardware; and updated\ndocumentation of the ipmitool delloem commands in the ipmitool manual\npage. (BZ#797050)\n\nAll users of OpenIPMI are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this\nenhancement.",
