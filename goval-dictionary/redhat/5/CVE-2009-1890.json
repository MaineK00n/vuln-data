    "Description": "The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy module when it\nwas used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw to force\na proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. (CVE-2009-1890)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This\nmodule continued to compress large files until compression was complete,\neven if the network connection that requested the content was closed before\ncompression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large\namounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. (CVE-2009-1891)\n\nAll httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
