    "Description": "The ipsec-tools package is used in conjunction with the IPsec functionality\nin the Linux kernel and includes racoon, an IKEv1 keying daemon.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the ipsec-tools racoon daemon. An\nunauthenticated, remote attacker could trigger a NULL pointer dereference\nthat could cause the racoon daemon to crash. (CVE-2009-1574)\n\nMultiple memory leak flaws were found in the ipsec-tools racoon daemon. If\na remote attacker is able to make multiple connection attempts to the\nracoon daemon, it was possible to cause the racoon daemon to consume all\navailable memory. (CVE-2009-1632)\n\nUsers of ipsec-tools should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Users must restart the racoon\ndaemon for this update to take effect.",
