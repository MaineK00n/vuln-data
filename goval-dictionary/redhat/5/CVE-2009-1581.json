    "Title": "RHSA-2009:1066: squirrelmail security update (Important)",
    "Description": "SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.\n\nA server-side code injection flaw was found in the SquirrelMail\n\"map_yp_alias\" function. If SquirrelMail was configured to retrieve a\nuser's IMAP server address from a Network Information Service (NIS) server\nvia the \"map_yp_alias\" function, an unauthenticated, remote attacker using\na specially-crafted username could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the web server. (CVE-2009-1579)\n\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. An\nattacker could construct a carefully crafted URL, which once visited by an \nunsuspecting user, could cause the user's web browser to execute malicious\nscript in the context of the visited SquirrelMail web page. (CVE-2009-1578)\n\nIt was discovered that SquirrelMail did not properly sanitize Cascading\nStyle Sheets (CSS) directives used in HTML mail. A remote attacker could\nsend a specially-crafted email that could place mail content above\nSquirrelMail's controls, possibly allowing phishing and cross-site\nscripting attacks. (CVE-2009-1581)\n\nUsers of squirrelmail should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
