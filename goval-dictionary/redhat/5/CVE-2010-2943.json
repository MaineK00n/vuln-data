    "Title": "RHSA-2010:0723: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ecryptfs_uid_hash() function in\nthe Linux kernel eCryptfs implementation. On systems that have the eCryptfs\nnetlink transport (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 does) or where the\n\"/dev/ecryptfs\" file has world writable permissions (which it does not, by\ndefault, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5), a local, unprivileged user could\nuse this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2010-2492, Important)\n\n* A miscalculation of the size of the free space of the initial directory\nentry in a directory leaf block was found in the Linux kernel Global File\nSystem 2 (GFS2) implementation. A local, unprivileged user with write\naccess to a GFS2-mounted file system could perform a rename operation on\nthat file system to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, possibly resulting\nin a denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-2798, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Xen hypervisor implementation when running a\nsystem that has an Intel CPU without Extended Page Tables (EPT) support.\nWhile attempting to dump information about a crashing fully-virtualized\nguest, the flaw could cause the hypervisor to crash the host as well. A\nuser with permissions to configure a fully-virtualized guest system could\nuse this flaw to crash the host. (CVE-2010-2938, Moderate)\n\n* Information leak flaws were found in the Linux kernel's Traffic Control\nUnit implementation. A local attacker could use these flaws to cause the\nkernel to leak kernel memory to user-space, possibly leading to the\ndisclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2942, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's XFS file system implementation.\nThe file handle lookup could return an invalid inode as valid. If an XFS\nfile system was mounted via NFS (Network File System), a local attacker\ncould access stale data or overwrite existing data that reused the inodes.\n(CVE-2010-2943, Moderate)\n\n* An integer overflow flaw was found in the extent range checking code in\nthe Linux kernel's ext4 file system implementation. A local, unprivileged\nuser with write access to an ext4-mounted file system could trigger this\nflaw by writing to a file at a very large file offset, resulting in a local\ndenial of service. (CVE-2010-3015, Moderate)\n\n* An information leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's USB\nimplementation. Certain USB errors could result in an uninitialized kernel\nbuffer being sent to user-space. An attacker with physical access to a\ntarget system could use this flaw to cause an information leak.\n(CVE-2010-1083, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Andre Osterhues for reporting CVE-2010-2492;\nGrant Diffey of CenITex for reporting CVE-2010-2798; Toshiyuki Okajima for\nreporting CVE-2010-3015; and Marcus Meissner for reporting CVE-2010-1083.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will\nbe available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the\nReferences.\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
