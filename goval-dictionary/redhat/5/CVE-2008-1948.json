    "Description": "The GnuTLS Library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and\nprotocols such as TLS. GnuTLS includes libtasn1, a library developed for\nASN.1 structures management that includes DER encoding and decoding.\n\nFlaws were found in the way GnuTLS handles malicious client connections. A\nmalicious remote client could send a specially crafted request to a service\nusing GnuTLS that could cause the service to crash. (CVE-2008-1948,\nCVE-2008-1949, CVE-2008-1950)\n\nWe believe it is possible to leverage the flaw CVE-2008-1948 to execute\narbitrary code but have been unable to prove this at the time of releasing\nthis advisory. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 includes applications, such as\nCUPS, that would be directly vulnerable to any such an exploit, however.\nConsequently, we have assigned it critical severity.\n\nUsers of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch that corrects these issues.",
