    "Title": "RHSA-2012:1323: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* A flaw was found in the way socket buffers (skb) requiring TSO (TCP\nsegment offloading) were handled by the sfc driver. If the skb did not fit\nwithin the minimum-size of the transmission queue, the network card could\nrepeatedly reset itself. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2012-3412, Important)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the xacct_add_tsk() function in the\nLinux kernel's taskstats subsystem. A local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to cause an information leak or a denial of service.\n(CVE-2012-3510, Moderate)\n\n* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs_bnode_read() function in the\nHFS Plus (HFS+) file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local\nuser able to mount a specially-crafted HFS+ file system image could use\nthis flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.\n(CVE-2012-2319, Low)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the msg_namelen variable in the rds_recvmsg()\nfunction of the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\nimplementation was initialized. A local, unprivileged user could use this\nflaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space. (CVE-2012-3430, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting\nCVE-2012-3412, and Alexander Peslyak for reporting CVE-2012-3510. The\nCVE-2012-3430 issue was discovered by the Red Hat InfiniBand team.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The cpuid_whitelist() function, masking the Enhanced Intel SpeedStep\n(EST) flag from all guests, prevented the \"cpuspeed\" service from working\nin the privileged Xen domain (dom0). CPU scaling was therefore not\npossible. With this update, cpuid_whitelist() is aware whether the domain\nexecuting CPUID is privileged or not, and enables the EST flag for dom0.\n(BZ#846125)\n\n* If a delayed-allocation write was performed before quota was enabled,\nthe kernel displayed the following warning message:\n\n    WARNING: at fs/quota/dquot.c:988 dquot_claim_space+0x77/0x112()\n\nThis was because information about the delayed allocation was not recorded\nin the quota structure. With this update, writes prior to enabling quota\nare properly accounted for, and the message is not displayed. (BZ#847326)\n\n* In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9, the DSCP (Differentiated Services Code\nPoint) netfilter module now supports mangling of the DSCP field.\n(BZ#847327)\n\n* Some subsystems clear the TIF_SIGPENDING flag during error handling in\nfork() paths. Previously, if the flag was cleared, the ERESTARTNOINTR error\ncode could be returned. The underlying source code has been modified so\nthat the error code is no longer returned. (BZ#847359)\n\n* An unnecessary check for the RXCW.CW bit could cause the Intel e1000e NIC\n(Network Interface Controller) to not work properly. The check has been\nremoved so that the Intel e1000e NIC works as expected. (BZ#852448)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
