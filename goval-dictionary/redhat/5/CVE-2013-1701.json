    "Description": "Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL\nRuntime environment for Mozilla Firefox.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web\npage containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nFirefox. (CVE-2013-1701)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox generated Certificate Request Message\nFormat (CRMF) requests. An attacker could use this flaw to perform\ncross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2013-1710)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the interaction between frames\nand browser history. An attacker could use this flaw to trick Firefox into\ntreating malicious content as if it came from the browser history, allowing\nfor XSS attacks. (CVE-2013-1709)\n\nIt was found that the same-origin policy could be bypassed due to the way\nUniform Resource Identifiers (URI) were checked in JavaScript. An attacker\ncould use this flaw to perform XSS attacks, or install malicious add-ons\nfrom third-party pages. (CVE-2013-1713)\n\nIt was found that web workers could bypass the same-origin policy. An\nattacker could use this flaw to perform XSS attacks. (CVE-2013-1714)\n\nIt was found that, in certain circumstances, Firefox incorrectly handled\nJava applets. If a user launched an untrusted Java applet via Firefox, the\napplet could use this flaw to obtain read-only access to files on the\nuser's local system. (CVE-2013-1717)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges Jeff Gilbert, Henrik Skupin, moz_bug_r_a4, Cody\nCrews, Federico Lanusse, and Georgi Guninski as the original reporters of\nthese issues.\n\nFor technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security\nadvisories for Firefox 17.0.8 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla\nadvisories in the References section of this erratum.\n\nAll Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nFirefox version 17.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing\nthe update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.",
