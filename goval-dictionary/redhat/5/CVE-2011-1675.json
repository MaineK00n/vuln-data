    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0307: util-linux security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Low)",
    "Description": "The util-linux package contains a large variety of low-level system\nutilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function. Among others,\nutil-linux contains the fdisk configuration tool and the login program.\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way the mount and umount commands\nperformed mtab (mounted file systems table) file updates. A local,\nunprivileged user allowed to mount or unmount file systems could use these\nflaws to corrupt the mtab file and create a stale lock file, preventing\nother users from mounting and unmounting file systems. (CVE-2011-1675,\nCVE-2011-1677)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When the user logged into a telnet server, the login utility did not\nupdate the utmp database properly if the utility was executed from the\ntelnetd daemon. This was due to telnetd not creating an appropriate entry\nin a utmp file before executing login. With this update, correct entries\nare created and the database is updated properly. (BZ#646300)\n\n* Various options were not described on the blockdev(8) manual page. With\nthis update, the blockdev(8) manual page includes all the relevant options.\n(BZ#650937)\n\n* Prior to this update, the build process of the util-linux package failed\nin the po directory with the following error message: \"@MKINSTALLDIRS@:\nNo such file or directory\". An upstream patch has been applied to address\nthis issue, and the util-linux package now builds successfully. (BZ#677452)\n\n* Previously, the ipcs(1) and ipcrm(1) manual pages mentioned an invalid\noption, \"-b\". With this update, only valid options are listed on those\nmanual pages. (BZ#678407)\n\n* Previously, the mount(8) manual page contained incomplete information\nabout the ext4 and XFS file systems. With this update, the mount(8) manual\npage contains the missing information. (BZ#699639)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* Previously, if DOS mode was enabled on a device, the fdisk utility could\nreport error messages similar to the following:\n\nPartition 1 has different physical/logical beginnings (non-Linux?):\nphys=(0, 1, 1) logical=(0, 2, 7)\n\nThis update enables users to switch off DOS compatible mode (by specifying\nthe \"-c\" option), and such error messages are no longer displayed.\n(BZ#678430)\n\n* This update adds the \"fsfreeze\" command which halts access to a file\nsystem on a disk. (BZ#726572)\n\nAll users of util-linux are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contains backported patches to correct these issues and add these\nenhancements.",
