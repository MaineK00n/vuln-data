    "Description": "The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer\nfor Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)\ndecompression algorithm implementation used by the CUPS GIF image format\nreader. An attacker could create a malicious GIF image file that, when\nprinted, could possibly cause CUPS to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the \"lp\" user. (CVE-2011-2896)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the \"Show Completed Jobs,\" \"Show All Jobs,\" and\n\"Show Active Jobs\" buttons returned results globally across all printers\nand not the results for the specified printer. With this update, jobs from\nonly the selected printer are shown. (BZ#625900)\n\n* Prior to this update, the code of the serial backend contained a wrong\ncondition. As a consequence, print jobs on the raw print queue could not be\ncanceled. This update modifies the condition in the serial backend code.\nNow, the user can cancel these print jobs. (BZ#625955)\n\n* Prior to this update, the textonly filter did not work if used as a pipe,\nfor example when the command line did not specify the filename and the\nnumber of copies was always 1. This update modifies the condition in the\ntextonly filter. Now, the data are sent to the printer regardless of the\nnumber of copies specified. (BZ#660518)\n\n* Prior to this update, the file descriptor count increased until it ran\nout of resources when the cups daemon was running with enabled\nSecurity-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) features. With this update, all resources\nare allocated only once. (BZ#668009)\n\n* Prior to this update, CUPS incorrectly handled the en_US.ASCII value for\nthe LANG environment variable. As a consequence, the lpadmin, lpstat, and\nlpinfo binaries failed to write to standard output if using LANG with the\nvalue. This update fixes the handling of the en_US.ASCII value and the\nbinaries now write to standard output properly. (BZ#759081)\n\nAll users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this\nupdate, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.",
