    "Description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nA heap overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM emulated the e1000\nnetwork interface card. A privileged guest user in a virtual machine whose\nnetwork interface is configured to use the e1000 emulated driver could use\nthis flaw to crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the\nhost. (CVE-2012-0029)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the KVM subsystem of a Linux kernel handled PIT\n(Programmable Interval Timer) IRQs (interrupt requests) when there was no\nvirtual interrupt controller set up. A malicious user in the kvm group on\nthe host could force this situation to occur, resulting in the host\ncrashing. (CVE-2011-4622)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Nicolae Mogoreanu for reporting CVE-2012-0029.\n\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in the\nSolution section must be performed before this update will take effect.",

The expansion worked correctly with the\ndefault configuration, but could have caused network setup failures when a\nuser-defined network script was used. This update changes the expansion so\nnetwork setup will not fail, even when a user-defined network script is\nused. (BZ#797191)\n\n* A bug was found in xenconsoled, the Xen hypervisor console daemon. If\ntimestamp logging for this daemon was enabled (using both the\nXENCONSOLED_TIMESTAMP_HYPERVISOR_LOG and XENCONSOLED_TIMESTAMP_GUEST_LOG\noptions in \"/etc/sysconfig/xend\"), xenconsoled could crash if the guest\nemitted a lot of information to its serial console in a short period of\ntime. Eventually, the guest would freeze after the console buffer was\nfilled due to the crashed xenconsoled. Timestamp logging is disabled by\ndefault. (BZ#797836)\n\nAll xen users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
