    "Title": "RHSA-2012:0103: squirrelmail security update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail\nperformed the sanitization of HTML style tag content. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to send a specially-crafted Multipurpose Internet Mail\nExtensions (MIME) message that, when opened by a victim, would lead to\narbitrary web script execution in the context of their SquirrelMail\nsession. (CVE-2011-2023)\n\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. A\nremote attacker could possibly use these flaws to execute arbitrary web\nscript in the context of a victim's SquirrelMail session. (CVE-2010-4555)\n\nAn input sanitization flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled the\ncontent of various HTML input fields. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to alter user preference values via a newline character contained in\nthe input for these fields. (CVE-2011-2752)\n\nIt was found that the SquirrelMail Empty Trash and Index Order pages did\nnot protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote\nattacker could trick a user, who was logged into SquirrelMail, into\nvisiting a specially-crafted URL, the attacker could empty the victim's\ntrash folder or alter the ordering of the columns on the message index\npage. (CVE-2011-2753)\n\nSquirrelMail was allowed to be loaded into an HTML sub-frame, allowing a\nremote attacker to perform a clickjacking attack against logged in users\nand possibly gain access to sensitive user data. With this update, the\nSquirrelMail main frame can only be loaded into the top most browser frame.\n(CVE-2010-4554)\n\nA flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A\nuser preference file was created when attempting to log in with a password\ncontaining an 8-bit character, even if the username was not valid. A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk\nspace on the target SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2010-2813)\n\nA flaw was found in the SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plug-in. If an\nadministrator enabled this plug-in, a SquirrelMail user could use this flaw\nto port scan the local network the server was on. (CVE-2010-1637)\n\nUsers of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
