    "Title": "RHSA-2009:1548: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local\nusers in the unconfined_t domain to map low memory areas even if the\nmmap_min_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local\nexploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the eCryptfs implementation\nin the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a local\ndenial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2908, Important)\n\n* a flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation. The kernel would do an\nunnecessary permission check after creating a file. This check would\nusually fail and leave the file with the permission bits set to random\nvalues. Note: This is a server-side only issue. (CVE-2009-3286, Important)\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following\nfunctions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and\npipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could\nbe released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's\nreader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)\n\n* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel. pci_unmap_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU\nspace exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could\nabuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.\n(CVE-2009-3613, Important)\n\n* missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. Padding data\nin several core network structures was not initialized properly before\nbeing sent to user-space. These flaws could lead to information leaks.\n(CVE-2009-3228, Moderate)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* with network bonding in the \"balance-tlb\" or \"balance-alb\" mode, the\nprimary setting for the primary slave device was lost when said device was\nbrought down. Bringing the slave back up did not restore the primary\nsetting. (BZ#517971)\n\n* some faulty serial device hardware caused systems running the kernel-xen\nkernel to take a very long time to boot. (BZ#524153)\n\n* a caching bug in nfs_readdir() may have caused NFS clients to see\nduplicate files or not see all files in a directory. (BZ#526960)\n\n* the RHSA-2009:1243 update removed the mpt_msi_enable option, preventing\ncertain scripts from running. This update adds the option back. (BZ#526963)\n\n* an iptables rule with the recent module and a hit count value greater\nthan the ip_pkt_list_tot parameter (the default is 20), did not have any\neffect over packets, as the hit count could not be reached. (BZ#527434)\n\n* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,\nto help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip_append_data() from\nbeing exploitable. (BZ#527436)\n\n* a kernel panic occurred in certain conditions after reconfiguring a tape\ndrive's block size. (BZ#528133)\n\n* when using the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) in a master and backup\nconfiguration, and propagating active connections on the master to the\nbackup, the connection timeout value on the backup was hard-coded to 180\nseconds, meaning connection information on the backup was soon lost. This\ncould prevent the successful failover of connections. The timeout value\ncan now be set via \"ipvsadm --set\". (BZ#528645)\n\n* a bug in nfs4_do_open_expired() could have caused the reclaimer thread on\nan NFSv4 client to enter an infinite loop. (BZ#529162)\n\n* MSI interrupts may not have been delivered for r8169 based network cards\nthat have MSI interrupts enabled. This bug only affected certain systems.\n(BZ#529366)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
