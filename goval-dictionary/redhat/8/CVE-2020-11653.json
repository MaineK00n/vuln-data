    "Title": "RHSA-2020:4756: varnish:6 security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "Varnish Cache is a high-performance HTTP accelerator. It stores web pages in memory so web servers don't have to create the same web page over and over again, giving the website a significant speed up.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: varnish (6.0.6). (BZ#1795673)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* varnish: denial of service handling certain crafted HTTP/1 requests (CVE-2019-15892)\n\n* varnish: remote clients may cause Varnish to assert and restart which could result in DoS (CVE-2020-11653)\n\n* varnish: not clearing pointer between two client requests leads to information disclosure (CVE-2019-20637)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
