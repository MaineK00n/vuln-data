    "Title": "RHSA-2021:2354: libwebp security update (Important)",
    "Description": "The libwebp packages provide a library and tools for the WebP graphics format. WebP is an image format with a lossy compression of digital photographic images. WebP consists of a codec based on the VP8 format, and a container based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Webmasters, web developers and browser developers can use WebP to compress, archive, and distribute digital images more efficiently.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* libwebp: heap-based buffer overflow in PutLE16() (CVE-2018-25011)\n\n* libwebp: heap-based buffer overflow in WebPDecode*Into functions (CVE-2020-36328)\n\n* libwebp: use-after-free in EmitFancyRGB() in dec/io_dec.c (CVE-2020-36329)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
