    "Title": "RHSA-2021:1608: python-cryptography security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
    "Description": "The python-cryptography packages contain a Python Cryptographic Authority's (PyCA's) cryptography library, which provides cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: python-cryptography (3.2.1). (BZ#1873581, BZ#1891947)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* python-cryptography: bleichenbacher timing oracle attack against RSA decryption (CVE-2020-25659)\n\n* python-cryptography: certain sequences of update() calls when symmetrically encrypting very large payloads could result in an integer overflow and lead to buffer overflows (CVE-2020-36242)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
