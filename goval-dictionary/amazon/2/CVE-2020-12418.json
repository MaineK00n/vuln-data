    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-12421:\n\tWhen performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.) This could have caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently without notification to the user. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 68.10, Firefox \u003c 78, and Thunderbird \u003c 68.10.0.\n1853018: CVE-2020-12421 Mozilla: Add-On updates did not respect the same certificate trust rules as software updates\n\nCVE-2020-12420:\n\tWhen trying to connect to a STUN server, a race condition could have caused a use-after-free of a pointer, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 68.10, Firefox \u003c 78, and Thunderbird \u003c 68.10.0.\n1853017: CVE-2020-12420 Mozilla: Use-After-Free when trying to connect to a STUN server\n\nCVE-2020-12419:\n\t1853016: CVE-2020-12419 Mozilla: Use-after-free in nsGlobalWindowInner\nWhen processing callbacks that occurred during window flushing in the parent process, the associated window may die; causing a use-after-free condition. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 68.10, Firefox \u003c 78, and Thunderbird \u003c 68.10.0.\n\nCVE-2020-12418:\n\tManipulating individual parts of a URL object could have caused an out-of-bounds read, leaking process memory to malicious JavaScript. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 68.10, Firefox \u003c 78, and Thunderbird \u003c 68.10.0.\n1853015: CVE-2020-12418 Mozilla: Information disclosure due to manipulated URL object\n\nCVE-2020-12417:\n\tDue to confusion about ValueTags on JavaScript Objects, an object may pass through the type barrier, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. *Note: this issue only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.* This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 68.10, Firefox \u003c 78, and Thunderbird \u003c 68.10.0.\n1853014: CVE-2020-12417 Mozilla: Memory corruption due to missing sign-extension for ValueTags on ARM64\n",
