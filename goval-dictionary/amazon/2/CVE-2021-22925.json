    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-22925:\n\t1970902: CVE-2021-22925 curl: Incorrect fix for CVE-2021-22898 TELNET stack contents disclosure\nA flaw was found in the way curl handled telnet protocol option for sending environment variables, which could lead to sending of uninitialized data from a stack-based buffer to the server. This issue leads to potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.\n\nCVE-2021-22924:\n\t1981460: CVE-2021-22924 curl: Bad connection reuse due to flawed path name checks\nA flaw was found in libcurl in the way libcurl handles previously used connections without accounting for 'issuer cert' and comparing the involved paths case-insensitively. This flaw allows libcurl to use the wrong connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2021-22923:\n\t1981438: CVE-2021-22923 curl: Metalink download sends credentials\nA flaw was found in curl in the way curl handles credentials when downloading content using the Metalink feature. This flaw allows malicious actors controlling a hosting server to gain access to credentials provided while downloading content without the user's knowledge. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2021-22922:\n\t1981435: CVE-2021-22922 curl: Content not matching hash in Metalink is not being discarded\nA flaw was found in curl in the way curl handles a file hash mismatch after downloading content using the Metalink feature. This flaw allows malicious actors controlling a hosting server to trick users into downloading malicious content. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n\nCVE-2021-22898:\n\t1964887: CVE-2021-22898 curl: TELNET stack contents disclosure\nA flaw was found in the way curl handled telnet protocol option for sending environment variables, which could lead to sending of uninitialized data from a stack-based buffer to the server. This issue leads to potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.\n",
