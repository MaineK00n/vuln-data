    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-23987:\n\t1942787: CVE-2021-23987 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 87 and Firefox ESR 78.9\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this issue as:\nMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 86 and Firefox ESR 78.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2021-23984:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this issue as:\nA malicious extension could have opened a popup window lacking an address bar. The title of the popup lacking an address bar should not be fully controllable, but in this situation was. This could have been used to spoof a website and attempt to trick the user into providing credentials.\n1942786: CVE-2021-23984 Mozilla: Malicious extensions could have spoofed popup information\n\nCVE-2021-23982:\n\t1942785: CVE-2021-23982 Mozilla: Internal network hosts could have been probed by a malicious webpage\nUsing techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have scanned both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine utilizing WebRTC connections. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Thunderbird \u003c 78.9, and Firefox \u003c 87.\n\nCVE-2021-23981:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this issue as:\nA texture upload of a Pixel Buffer Object could have confused the WebGL code to skip binding the buffer used to unpack it, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable information leak or crash.\n1942783: CVE-2021-23981 Mozilla: Texture upload into an unbound backing buffer resulted in an out-of-bound read\n",
