    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-12410:\n\tMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 76 and Firefox ESR 68.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
