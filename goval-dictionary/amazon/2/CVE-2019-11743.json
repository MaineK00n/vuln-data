    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-11752:\n\tIt is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u0026lt; 69, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 68.1, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 60.9, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 60.9, and Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 68.1.\n1748657: \nCVE-2019-11752 Mozilla: Use-after-free while extracting a key value in IndexedDB\n\nCVE-2019-11746:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u0026lt; 69, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 68.1, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 60.9, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 60.9, and Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 68.1.\n1748656: \nCVE-2019-11746 Mozilla: Use-after-free while manipulating video\n\nCVE-2019-11744:\n\tSome HTML elements, such as \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;textarea\u0026gt;, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to .innerHTML on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u0026lt; 69, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 68.1, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 60.9, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 60.9, and Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 68.1.\n1748655: \nCVE-2019-11744 Mozilla: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML\n\nCVE-2019-11743:\n\t1748654: \nCVE-2019-11743 Mozilla: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes\nNavigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C\u0026#039;s \u0026quot;Navigation-Timing Level 2\u0026quot; draft specification in some instances for the unload event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u0026lt; 69, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 68.1, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 60.9, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 60.9, and Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 68.1.\n\nCVE-2019-11742:\n\t1748653: \nCVE-2019-11742 Mozilla: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images\nA same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a \u0026lt;canvas\u0026gt; element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u0026lt; 69, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 68.1, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 60.9, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 60.9, and Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 68.1.\n\nCVE-2019-11740:\n\t1748652: \nCVE-2019-11740 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 69, Firefox ESR 68.1, Firefox ESR 60.9, Thunderbird 68.1, and Thunderbird 60.9\nMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68, Firefox ESR 68, and Firefox 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u0026lt; 69, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 68.1, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 60.9, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 60.9, and Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 68.1.\n\nCVE-2019-11739:\n\tEncrypted S/MIME parts in a crafted multipart/alternative message can leak plaintext when included in a a HTML reply/forward. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u0026lt; 68.1 and Thunderbird \u0026lt; 60.9.\n1752307: \nCVE-2019-11739 Mozilla: Covert Content Attack on S/MIME encryption using a crafted multipart/alternative message\n",
