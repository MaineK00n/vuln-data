    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-6464:\n\tA vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server\u0026#039;s parsing of configuration directives. A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a crafted message.\n1433987: \nCVE-2017-6464 ntp: Denial of Service via Malformed Config\n\nCVE-2017-6463:\n\tA vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server\u0026#039;s parsing of configuration directives. A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a crafted message.\n1434002: \nCVE-2017-6463 ntp: Authenticated DoS via Malicious Config Option\n\nCVE-2017-6462:\n\tA vulnerability was found in NTP, in the parsing of packets from the /dev/datum device. A malicious device could send crafted messages, causing ntpd to crash.\n1433995: \nCVE-2017-6462 ntp: Buffer Overflow in DPTS Clock\n\nCVE-2016-9311:\n\t1398350: \nCVE-2016-9311 ntp: Null pointer dereference when trap service is enabled\nA flaw was found in the way ntpd implemented the trap service. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2016-9310:\n\tA flaw was found in the control mode functionality of ntpd. A remote attacker could send a crafted control mode packet which could lead to information disclosure or result in DDoS amplification attacks.\n1397319: \nCVE-2016-9310 ntp: Mode 6 unauthenticated trap information disclosure and DDoS vector\n\nCVE-2016-7433:\n\tA flaw was found in the way ntpd calculated the root delay. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted spoofed packet to cause denial of service or in some special cases even crash.\n1397347: \nCVE-2016-7433 ntp: Broken initial sync calculations regression\n\nCVE-2016-7429:\n\t1397341: \nCVE-2016-7429 ntp: Attack on interface selection\nA flaw was found in the way ntpd running on a host with multiple network interfaces handled certain server responses. A remote attacker could use this flaw which would cause ntpd to not synchronize with the source.\n\nCVE-2016-7426:\n\t1397345: \nCVE-2016-7426 ntp: Client rate limiting and server responses\nIt was found that when ntp is configured with rate limiting for all associations the limits are also applied to responses received from its configured sources. A remote attacker who knows the sources can cause a denial of service by preventing ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources.\n",
