    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-34558:\n\t1983596: CVE-2021-34558 golang: crypto/tls: certificate of wrong type is causing TLS client to panic\nA flaw was found in golang. A panic can be triggered by an attacker in a privileged network position without access to the server certificate's private key, as long as a trusted ECDSA or Ed25519 certificate for the server exists (or can be issued), or the client is configured with Config.InsecureSkipVerify. Clients that disable all TLS_RSA cipher suites (that is, TLS 1.0-1.2 cipher suites without ECDHE), as well as TLS 1.3-only clients, are unaffected.\n\nCVE-2021-33198:\n\t1989575: CVE-2021-33198 golang: math/big.Rat: may cause a panic or an unrecoverable fatal error if passed inputs with very large exponents\nA flaw was found in Go, where it attempts to allocate excessive memory. This issue may cause panic or unrecoverable fatal error if passed inputs with very large exponents. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-33197:\n\tA flaw was found in Go, acting as an unintended proxy or intermediary, where ReverseProxy forwards connection headers if the first one was empty. This flaw allows an attacker to drop arbitrary headers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n1989570: CVE-2021-33197 golang: net/http/httputil: ReverseProxy forwards connection headers if first one is empty\n",
