If a malicious, local user could access this directory, they could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running \"make distcheck\".\nThe \"make distcheck\" rule in GNU Automake before 1.11.6 and 1.12.x before 1.12.2 grants world-writable permissions to the extraction directory, which introduces a race condition that allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n",
