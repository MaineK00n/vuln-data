If the TCP Illinois congestion control algorithm were in use (the sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control variable set to \"illinois\"), a local, unprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause a denial of service.\n871848: \nCVE-2012-4565 kernel: net: divide by zero in tcp algorithm illinois\n\nCVE-2012-4508:\n\t* A race condition in the way asynchronous I/O and fallocate() interacted when using ext4 could allow a local, unprivileged user to obtain random data from a deleted file.\n869904: \nCVE-2012-4508 kernel: ext4: AIO vs fallocate stale data exposure\n\nCVE-2012-3511:\n\t* A use-after-free flaw was found in the madvise() system call implementation in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their privileges.\nMultiple race conditions in the madvise_remove function in mm/madvise.c in the Linux kernel before 3.4.5 allow local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) via vectors involving a (1) munmap or (2) close system call.\n849734: \nCVE-2012-3511 kernel: mm: use-after-free in madvise_remove()\n\nCVE-2012-3400:\n\t* Buffer overflow flaws were found in the udf_load_logicalvol() function in the Universal Disk Format (UDF) file system implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker with physical access to a system could use these flaws to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.\n843139: \nCVE-2012-3400 kernel: udf: buffer overflow when parsing sparing table\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the udf_load_logicalvol function in fs/udf/super.c in the Linux kernel before 3.4.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted UDF filesystem.\n\nCVE-2012-2133:\n\t* A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem in the way quota handling for huge pages was performed. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their privileges.\n817430: \nCVE-2012-2133 kernel: use after free bug in \"quota\" handling\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel before 3.3.6, when huge pages are enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges by interacting with a hugetlbfs filesystem, as demonstrated by a umount operation that triggers improper handling of quota data.\n\nCVE-2012-1568:\n\t804947: \nCVE-2012-1568 kernel: execshield: predictable ascii armour base address\n* It was found that when running a 32-bit binary that uses a large number of shared libraries, one of the libraries would always be loaded at a predictable address in memory.
