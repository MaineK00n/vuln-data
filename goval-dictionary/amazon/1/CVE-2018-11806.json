    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-7550:\n\tQuick Emulator (QEMU), compiled with the PC System Emulator with multiboot feature support, is vulnerable to an OOB r/w memory access issue. The issue could occur while loading a kernel image during the guest boot, if mh_load_end_addr address is greater than the mh_bss_end_addr address. A user or process could use this flaw to potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on a host.\n1549798: \nCVE-2018-7550 QEMU: i386: multiboot OOB access while loading kernel image\n\nCVE-2018-11806:\n\t1586245: \nCVE-2018-11806 QEMU: slirp: heap buffer overflow while reassembling fragmented datagrams\nA heap buffer overflow issue was found in the way SLiRP networking back-end in QEMU processes fragmented packets. It could occur while reassembling the fragmented datagrams of an incoming packet. A privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS or potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process.\n",
