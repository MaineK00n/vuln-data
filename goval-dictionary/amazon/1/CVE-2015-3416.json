A local attacker could submit a specially crafted SELECT statement that would crash the SQLite process, or have other unspecified impacts.\n\nCVE-2015-3415:\n\tThe sqlite3VdbeExec function in vdbe.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly implement comparison operators, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free operation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted CHECK clause, as demonstrated by CHECK(0\u0026O;\u0026gt;O) in a CREATE TABLE statement.\nIt was found that SQLite's sqlite3VdbeExec() function did not properly implement comparison operators. A local attacker could submit a specially crafted CHECK statement that would crash the SQLite process, or have other unspecified impacts.\n1212356: \nCVE-2015-3415 sqlite: invalid free() in src/vdbe.c\n\nCVE-2015-3414:\n\t1212353: \nCVE-2015-3414 sqlite: use of uninitialized memory when parsing collation sequences in src/where.c\nA flaw was found in the way SQLite handled dequoting of collation-sequence names. A local attacker could submit a specially crafted COLLATE statement that would crash the SQLite process, or have other unspecified impacts.\nSQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly implement the dequoting of collation-sequence names, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted COLLATE clause, as demonstrated by COLLATE\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" at the end of a SELECT statement.\n",
