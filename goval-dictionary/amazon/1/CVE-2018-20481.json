    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-9631:\n\tPoppler 0.74.0 has a heap-based buffer over-read in the CairoRescaleBox.cc downsample_row_box_filter function.\n1686802: \nCVE-2019-9631 poppler: heap-based buffer over-read in function downsample_row_box_filter in CairoRescaleBox.cc\n\nCVE-2019-9200:\n\t1683632: \nCVE-2019-9200 poppler: heap-based buffer overflow in function ImageStream::getLine() in Stream.cc\nA heap-based buffer underwrite exists in ImageStream::getLine() located at Stream.cc in Poppler 0.74.0 that can (for example) be triggered by sending a crafted PDF file to the pdfimages binary. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.\n\nCVE-2019-7310:\n\tIn Poppler 0.73.0, a heap-based buffer over-read (due to an integer signedness error in the XRef::getEntry function in XRef.cc) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document, as demonstrated by pdftocairo.\n1672419: \nCVE-2019-7310 poppler: heap-based buffer over-read in XRef::getEntry in XRef.cc\n\nCVE-2018-20662:\n\tIn Poppler 0.72.0, PDFDoc::setup in PDFDoc.cc allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash caused by Object.h SIGABRT, because of a wrong return value from PDFDoc::setup) by crafting a PDF file in which an xref data structure is mishandled during extractPDFSubtype processing.\n1665273: \nCVE-2018-20662 poppler: SIGABRT PDFDoc::setup class in PDFDoc.cc\n\nCVE-2018-20650:\n\tA reachable Object::dictLookup assertion in Poppler 0.72.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service due to the lack of a check for the dict data type, as demonstrated by use of the FileSpec class (in FileSpec.cc) in pdfdetach.\n1665263: \nCVE-2018-20650 poppler: reachable Object::dictLookup assertion in FileSpec class in FileSpec.cc\n\nCVE-2018-20481:\n\t1665266: \nCVE-2018-20481 poppler: NULL pointer dereference in the XRef::getEntry in XRef.cc\nXRef::getEntry in XRef.cc in Poppler 0.72.0 mishandles unallocated XRef entries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted PDF document, when XRefEntry::setFlag in XRef.h is called from Parser::makeStream in Parser.cc.\n\nCVE-2018-19149:\n\tPoppler before 0.70.0 has a NULL pointer dereference in _poppler_attachment_new when called from poppler_annot_file_attachment_get_attachment.\n1649457: \nCVE-2018-19149 poppler: NULL pointer dereference in _poppler_attachment_new\n\nCVE-2018-19060:\n\t1649450: \nCVE-2018-19060 poppler: pdfdetach utility does not validate save paths\nAn issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a NULL pointer dereference in goo/GooString.h, will lead to denial of service, as demonstrated by utils/pdfdetach.cc not validating a filename of an embedded file before constructing a save path.\n\nCVE-2018-19059:\n\t1649440: \nCVE-2018-19059 poppler: out-of-bounds read in EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc\nAn issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a out-of-bounds read in EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc, will lead to denial of service, as demonstrated by utils/pdfdetach.cc not validating embedded files before save attempts.\n\nCVE-2018-19058:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a reachable abort in Object.h, will lead to denial of service because EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc lacks a stream check before saving an embedded file.\n1649435: \nCVE-2018-19058 poppler: reachable abort in Object.h\n\nCVE-2018-18897:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a memory leak in GfxColorSpace::setDisplayProfile in GfxState.cc, as demonstrated by pdftocairo.\n1646546: \nCVE-2018-18897 poppler: memory leak in GfxColorSpace::setDisplayProfile in GfxState.cc\n\nCVE-2018-16646:\n\t1626618: \nCVE-2018-16646 poppler: infinite recursion in Parser::getObj function in Parser.cc\nIn Poppler 0.68.0, the Parser::getObj() function in Parser.cc may cause infinite recursion via a crafted file. A remote attacker can leverage this for a DoS attack.\n",
