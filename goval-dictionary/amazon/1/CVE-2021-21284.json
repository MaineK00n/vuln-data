Pulling an intentionally malformed Docker image manifest could lead to a crash of the `dockerd` daemon, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n1924742: CVE-2021-21285 docker: daemon crash during image pull of malicious image\n\nCVE-2021-21284:\n\tA flaw was found in the `userns-remap` feature of Docker.
