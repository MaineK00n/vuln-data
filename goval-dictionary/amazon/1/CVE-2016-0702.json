    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2016-2842:\n\t1314757: \nCVE-2016-2842 openssl: doapr_outch function does not verify that certain memory allocation succeeds\nThe doapr_outch function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not verify that a certain memory allocation succeeds, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write or memory consumption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large amount of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0799.\n\nCVE-2016-0800:\n\tA padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0 (SSLv2) protocol. An attacker can potentially use this flaw to decrypt RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol version, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol attack is publicly referred to as DROWN.\nA padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0 (SSLv2) protocol. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to decrypt RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol version, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol attack is publicly referred to as DROWN.\n1310593: \nCVE-2016-0800 SSL/TLS: Cross-protocol attack on TLS using SSLv2 (DROWN)\n\nCVE-2016-0799:\n\t1312219: \nCVE-2016-0799 OpenSSL: Fix memory issues in BIO_*printf functions\nThe fmtstr function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g improperly calculates string lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (overflow and out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large amount of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-2842.\n\nCVE-2016-0797:\n\t1311880: \nCVE-2016-0797 OpenSSL: BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn NULL pointer deref/heap corruption\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a heap-based memory corruption, was found in the way some BIGNUM functions of OpenSSL were implemented. Applications that use these functions with large untrusted input could crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2016-0705:\n\tA double-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain malformed DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) private keys. An attacker could create specially crafted DSA private keys that, when processed by an application compiled against OpenSSL, could cause the application to crash.\n1310596: \nCVE-2016-0705 OpenSSL: Double-free in DSA code\n\nCVE-2016-0702:\n\t1310599: \nCVE-2016-0702 OpenSSL: Side channel attack on modular exponentiation\nA side-channel attack was found that makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker who has the ability to control code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded core as the victim\u0026#039;s thread that is performing decryption, could use this flaw to recover RSA private keys.\n\nCVE-2015-7575:\n\t1289841: \nCVE-2015-7575 TLS 1.2 Transcipt Collision attacks against MD5 in key exchange protocol (SLOTH)\nA flaw was found in the way TLS 1.2 could use the MD5 hash function for signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a TLS handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to force a TLS connection to use the MD5 hash function could use this flaw to conduct collision attacks to impersonate a TLS server or an authenticated TLS client.\n\nCVE-2015-3197:\n\tA flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the server. This could result in weak SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n1301846: \nCVE-2015-3197 OpenSSL: SSLv2 doesn't block disabled ciphers\nA flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that were disabled on the server. This could result in weak SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n",
