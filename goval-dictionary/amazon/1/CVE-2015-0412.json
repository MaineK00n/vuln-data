    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2015-0412:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JAX-WS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-0410:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) decoder in the Security component in OpenJDK handled negative length values. A specially crafted, DER-encoded input could cause a Java application to enter an infinite loop when decoded.\n\nCVE-2015-0408:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JAX-WS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-0407:\n\tAn information leak flaw was found in the Swing component in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-0395:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the Hotspot garbage collector handled phantom references. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and, possibly, execute arbitrary code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-0383:\n\tMultiple insecure temporary file use issues were found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK created performance statistics and error log files. A local attacker could possibly make a victim using OpenJDK overwrite arbitrary files using a symlink attack.\n\nCVE-2014-6601:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK verified bytecode from the class files. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6593:\n\tIt was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component in OpenJDK failed to properly check whether the ChangeCipherSpec was received during the SSL/TLS connection handshake. An MITM attacker could possibly use this flaw to force a connection to be established without encryption being enabled.\n\nCVE-2014-6591:\n\tMultiple boundary check flaws were found in the font parsing code in the 2D component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could allow an untrusted Java application or applet to disclose portions of the Java Virtual Machine memory.\n\nCVE-2014-6587:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MulticastSocket implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6585:\n\tMultiple boundary check flaws were found in the font parsing code in the 2D component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could allow an untrusted Java application or applet to disclose portions of the Java Virtual Machine memory.\n\nCVE-2014-3566:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the SSL 3.0 protocol handled padding bytes when decrypting messages that were encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw could possibly allow a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to decrypt portions of the cipher text using a padding oracle attack.\n",
