    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2016-6306:\n\t1377594: \nCVE-2016-6306 openssl: certificate message OOB reads\nMultiple out of bounds read flaws were found in the way OpenSSL handled certain TLS/SSL protocol handshake messages. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to crash a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL.\n\nCVE-2016-6302:\n\t1369855: \nCVE-2016-6302 openssl: Insufficient TLS session ticket HMAC length checks\nAn integer underflow flaw leading to a buffer over-read was found in the way OpenSSL parsed TLS session tickets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a TLS server using OpenSSL if it used SHA-512 as HMAC for session tickets.\n\nCVE-2016-2183:\n\t1369383: \nCVE-2016-2183 SSL/TLS: Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers (SWEET32)\nA flaw was found in the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite.\n\nCVE-2016-2182:\n\tAn out of bounds write flaw was discovered in the OpenSSL BN_bn2dec() function. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL to process a large BIGNUM could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n1367340: \nCVE-2016-2182 openssl: Out-of-bounds write caused by unchecked errors in BN_bn2dec()\n\nCVE-2016-2181:\n\t1369113: \nCVE-2016-2181 openssl: DTLS replay protection bypass allows DoS against DTLS connection\nA flaw was found in the Datagram TLS (DTLS) replay protection implementation in OpenSSL. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a DTLS server using OpenSSL to reject further packets sent from a DTLS client over an established DTLS connection.\n\nCVE-2016-2180:\n\t1359615: \nCVE-2016-2180 OpenSSL: OOB read in TS_OBJ_print_bio()\nAn out of bounds read flaw was found in the way OpenSSL formatted Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol data for printing. An attacker could possibly cause an application using OpenSSL to crash if it printed time stamp data from the attacker.\n\nCVE-2016-2179:\n\t1369504: \nCVE-2016-2179 openssl: DTLS memory exhaustion DoS when messages are not removed from fragment buffer\nIt was discovered that the Datagram TLS (DTLS) implementation could fail to release memory in certain cases. A malicious DTLS client could cause a DTLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory.\n\nCVE-2016-2178:\n\tIt was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system.\n1343400: \nCVE-2016-2178 openssl: Non-constant time codepath followed for certain operations in DSA implementation\n\nCVE-2016-2177:\n\t1341705: \nCVE-2016-2177 openssl: Possible integer overflow vulnerabilities in codebase\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash.\n",
