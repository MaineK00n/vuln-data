A remote attacker could send specially crafted data to the Squid proxy, which would exploit the cachemgr CGI utility, possibly triggering execution of arbitrary code.\n1359203: \nCVE-2016-5408 squid: Buffer overflow vulnerability in cachemgr.cgi tool\n\nCVE-2016-4051:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Squid cachemgr.cgi utility processed remotely relayed Squid input. When the CGI interface utility is used, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code.\n1329126: \nCVE-2016-4051 squid: buffer overflow in cachemgr.cgi\n",
