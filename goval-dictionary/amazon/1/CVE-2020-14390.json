    "Title": "ALAS-2020-1437",
    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-26088:\n\t1882508: CVE-2020-26088 kernel: missing CAP_NET_RAW check in NFC socket creation in net/nfc/rawsock.c allows local attackers to create raw sockets\nA missing capabilities check when creating NFC raw sockets could be used by local attackers to create raw sockets, bypassing security mechanisms allowing them to create or listen to NFC communication frames.\n\nCVE-2020-25645:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Traffic between two Geneve endpoints may be unencrypted when IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel allowing anyone in between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n1883988: CVE-2020-25645 kernel: Geneve/IPsec traffic may be unencrypted between two Geneve endpoints\n\nCVE-2020-25643:\n\t1879981: CVE-2020-25643 kernel: improper input validation in ppp_cp_parse_cr function leads to memory corruption and read overflow\nA flaw was found in the HDLC_PPP module of the Linux kernel.  Memory corruption and a read overflow is caused by improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr function which can cause the system to crash or cause a denial of service.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-25641:\n\t1881424: CVE-2020-25641 kernel: soft-lockups in iov_iter_copy_from_user_atomic() could result in DoS\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of biovecs. A zero-length biovec request issued by the block subsystem could cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, causing a denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with basic privileges to issue requests to a block device, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-25285:\n\tA race condition between hugetlb sysctl handlers in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.8 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory, cause a NULL pointer dereference, or possibly have unspecified other impact, aka CID-17743798d812.\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernels sysctl handling code for hugepages management. When multiple root level processes would write to modify the /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages file it could create a race on internal variables leading to a system crash or memory corruption.\n1882591: CVE-2020-25285 kernel: race condition between hugetlb sysctl handlers in mm/hugetlb.c\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernels sysctl handling code for hugepages managment. When multiple root level processes would write to modify the /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages file it could create a race on internal variables leading to a system crash or memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2020-25284:\n\tA flaw was found in the capabilities check of the rados block device functionality in the Linux kernel. Incorrect capability checks could alllow a local user with root priviledges (but no capabilities) to add or remove Rados Block Devices from the system.\n1882594: CVE-2020-25284 kernel: incomplete permission checking for access to rbd devices\n\nCVE-2020-25212:\n\t1877575: CVE-2020-25212 kernel: TOCTOU mismatch in the NFS client code\nA flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation where when mounting a remote attacker controlled server it could return specially crafted response allow for local memory corruption and possibly privilege escalation.\nA TOCTOU mismatch in the NFS client code in the Linux kernel before 5.8.3 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory or possibly have unspecified other impact because a size check is in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c instead of fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c, aka CID-b4487b935452.\n\nCVE-2020-14390:\n\t1876788: CVE-2020-14390 kernel: out-of-bounds write in fbcon_redraw_softback\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. When changing screen size, an out-of-bounds memory write can occur leading to memory corruption or a denial of service. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.\n\nCVE-2020-14331:\n\t99999: \nCVE-2020-14331 kernel: kernel: buffer over write in vgacon_scroll\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the invert video code on VGA consoles when a local attacker attempts to resize the console, calling an ioctl VT_RESIZE, which causes an out-of-bounds write to occur. This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n1858679: CVE-2020-14331 kernel: kernel: buffer over write in vgacon_scroll\n\nCVE-2020-14314:\n\tA memory out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext3/ext4 file system, in the way it accesses a directory with broken indexing. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system if the directory exists. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\nA memory out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc2 with the ext3/ext4 file system, in the way it accesses a directory with broken indexing. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system if the directory exists. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n1853922: CVE-2020-14314 kernel: buffer uses out of index in ext3/4 filesystem\n\nCVE-2020-12888:\n\t1836244: CVE-2020-12888 Kernel: vfio: access to disabled MMIO space of some devices may lead to DoS scenario\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where it allows userspace processes, for example, a guest VM, to directly access h/w devices via its VFIO driver modules. The VFIO modules allow users to enable or disable access to the devices' MMIO memory address spaces. If a user attempts to access the read/write devices' MMIO address space when it is disabled, some h/w devices issue an interrupt to the CPU to indicate a fatal error condition, crashing the system. This flaw allows a guest user or process to crash the host system resulting in a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2019-19448:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of BTRFS free space management, where the kernel does not correctly manage the lifetime of internal data structures used. An attacker could use this flaw to corrupt memory or escalate privileges.\nIn the Linux kernel 5.0.21 and 5.3.11, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image, performing some operations, and then making a syncfs system call can lead to a use-after-free in try_merge_free_space in fs/btrfs/free-space-cache.c because the pointer to a left data structure can be the same as the pointer to a right data structure.\n1781674: CVE-2019-19448 kernel: mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image, performing some operations, and then making a syncfs system call can lead to a use-after-free in try_merge_free_space in fs/btrfs/free-space-cache.c\n",
