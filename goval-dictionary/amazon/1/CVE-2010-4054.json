    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2010-4820:\n\tGhostscript included the current working directory in its library search path by default. If a user ran Ghostscript without the \"-P-\" option in an attacker-controlled directory containing a specially-crafted PostScript library file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript code. With this update, Ghostscript no longer searches the current working directory for library files by default.\n\nCVE-2010-4054:\n\tA flaw was found in the way Ghostscript interpreted PostScript Type 1 and PostScript Type 2 font files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript Type 1 or PostScript Type 2 font file that, when interpreted, could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\nThe gs_type2_interpret function in Ghostscript allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer dereference and application crash) via crafted font data in a compressed data stream, aka bug 691043.\n\nCVE-2010-2055:\n\tGhostscript 8.71 and earlier reads initialization files from the current working directory, which allows local users to execute arbitrary PostScript commands via a Trojan horse file, related to improper support for the -P- option to the gs program.\nIt was found that Ghostscript always tried to read Ghostscript system initialization files from the current working directory before checking other directories, even if a search path that did not contain the current working directory was specified with the \"-I\" option, or the \"-P-\" option was used (to prevent the current working directory being searched first). If a user ran Ghostscript in an attacker-controlled directory containing a system initialization file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript code.\n\nCVE-2009-3743:\n\tOff-by-one error in the Ins_MINDEX function in the TrueType bytecode interpreter in Ghostscript before 8.71 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via a malformed TrueType font in a document that trigger an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer overflow.\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in Ghostscript's TrueType bytecode interpreter. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript or PDF file that, when interpreted, could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n",
