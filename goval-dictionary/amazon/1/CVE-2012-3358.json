    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-3358:\n\tMultiple heap-based buffer overflows in the j2k_read_sot function in j2k.c in OpenJPEG 1.5 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) tile number or (2) tile length in a JPEG 2000 image file.\n835767: \nCVE-2012-3358 openjpeg: heap-based buffer overflow when processing JPEG2000 image files\nAn input validation flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the way OpenJPEG handled the tile number and size in an image tile header. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted image file that, when decoded using an application linked against OpenJPEG, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n\nCVE-2009-5030:\n\t812317: \nCVE-2009-5030 openjpeg: Heap memory corruption leading to invalid free by processing certain Gray16 TIFF images\nThe tcd_free_encode function in tcd.c in OpenJPEG 1.3 through 1.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tile information in a Gray16 TIFF image, which causes insufficient memory to be allocated and leads to an \"invalid free.\"\nOpenJPEG allocated insufficient memory when encoding JPEG 2000 files from input images that have certain color depths. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted image file that, when opened in an application linked against OpenJPEG (such as image_to_j2k), would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n",
