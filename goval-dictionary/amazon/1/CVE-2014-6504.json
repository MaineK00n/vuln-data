An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6468:\n\tIt was discovered that the Hotspot component in OpenJDK failed to properly handle malformed Shared Archive files. A local attacker able to modify a Shared Archive file used by a virtual machine of a different user could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges.\n\nCVE-2014-6457:\n\tIt was discovered that the TLS/SSL implementation in the JSSE component in OpenJDK failed to properly verify the server identity during the renegotiation following session resumption, making it possible for malicious TLS/SSL servers to perform a Triple Handshake attack against clients using JSSE and client certificate authentication.\n",
