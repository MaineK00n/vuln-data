    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2011-3190:\n\tCertain AJP protocol connector implementations in Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.20, 6.0.0 through 6.0.33, 5.5.0 through 5.5.33, and possibly other versions allow remote attackers to spoof AJP requests, bypass authentication, and obtain sensitive information by causing the connector to interpret a request body as a new request.\nA flaw was found in the way the Coyote (org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpProcessor) and APR (org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpAprProcessor) Tomcat AJP (Apache JServ Protocol) connectors processed certain POST requests. An attacker could send a specially-crafted request that would cause the connector to treat the message body as a new request. This allows arbitrary AJP messages to be injected, possibly allowing an attacker to bypass a web application's authentication checks and gain access to information they would otherwise be unable to access. The JK (org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler) connector is used by default when the APR libraries are not present. The JK connector is not affected by this flaw.\n\nCVE-2011-2204:\n\tApache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.17, when the MemoryUserDatabase is used, creates log entries containing passwords upon encountering errors in JMX user creation, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading a log file.\nA flaw was found in the Tomcat MemoryUserDatabase. If a runtime exception occurred when creating a new user with a JMX client, that user's password was logged to Tomcat log files. Note: By default, only administrators have access to such log files.\n\nCVE-2011-1184:\n\tThe HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not have the expected countermeasures against replay attacks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the network for valid requests, related to lack of checking of nonce (aka server nonce) and nc (aka nonce-count or client nonce count) values.\nMultiple flaws were found in the way Tomcat handled HTTP DIGEST authentication. These flaws weakened the Tomcat HTTP DIGEST authentication implementation, subjecting it to some of the weaknesses of HTTP BASIC authentication, for example, allowing remote attackers to perform session replay attacks.\n",
