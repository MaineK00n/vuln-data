A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make Java accept certificate using one of the disabled algorithms.\n\nCVE-2017-10193:\n\t1471715: \nCVE-2017-10193 OpenJDK: incorrect key size constraint check (Security, 8179101)\n\nCVE-2017-10135:\n\tA covert timing channel flaw was found in the PKCS#8 implementation in the JCE component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker able to make a Java application repeatedly compare PKCS#8 key against an attacker controlled value could possibly use this flaw to determine the key via a timing side channel.\n1471871: \nCVE-2017-10135 OpenJDK: PKCS#8 implementation timing attack (JCE, 8176760)\n\nCVE-2017-10116:\n\t1471738: \nCVE-2017-10116 OpenJDK: LDAPCertStore following referrals to non-LDAP URLs (Security, 8176067)\nIt was discovered that the LDAPCertStore class in the Security component of OpenJDK followed LDAP referrals to arbitrary URLs. A specially crafted LDAP referral URL could cause LDAPCertStore to communicate with non-LDAP servers.\n\nCVE-2017-10115:\n\t1471851: \nCVE-2017-10115 OpenJDK: DSA implementation timing attack (JCE, 8175106)\nA covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA implementation in the JCE component of OpenJDK.

Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n1502858: \nCVE-2017-10345 OpenJDK: unbounded resource use in JceKeyStore deserialization (Serialization, 8181370)\n\nCVE-2017-10295:\n\tIt was found that the HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection classes in the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to check for newline characters embedded in URLs. An attacker able to make a Java application perform an HTTP request using an attacker provided URL could possibly inject additional headers into the request.\n1502687: \nCVE-2017-10295 OpenJDK: HTTP client insufficient check for newline in URLs (Networking, 8176751)\n\nCVE-2017-10285:\n\t1501868: \nCVE-2017-10285 OpenJDK: incorrect privilege use when handling unreferenced objects (RMI, 8174966)\nVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: RMI). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u161, 7u151, 8u144 and 9; Java SE Embedded: 8u144. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).

Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u161, 7u151, 8u144 and 9. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security.

A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make Java accept certificate using one of the disabled algorithms.\n\nCVE-2017-10193:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u151, 7u141 and 8u131; Java SE Embedded: 8u131. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data.
