    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-5581:\n\t867235: \nCVE-2012-5581 libtiff: Stack-based buffer overflow when reading a tiled tiff file\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff handled DOTRANGE tags. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\nStack-based buffer overflow in tif_dir.c in LibTIFF before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DOTRANGE tag in a TIFF image.\n\nCVE-2012-4564:\n\tA missing return value check flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the ppm2tiff tool. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted PPM (Portable Pixel Map) file that would cause ppm2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\nppm2tiff does not check the return value of the TIFFScanlineSize function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PPM image that triggers an integer overflow, a zero-memory allocation, and a heap-based buffer overflow.\n871700: \nCVE-2012-4564 libtiff: Missing return value check in ppm2tiff leading to heap-buffer overflow when reading a tiff file\n\nCVE-2012-4447:\n\t860198: \nCVE-2012-4447 libtiff: Heap-buffer overflow when processing a TIFF image with PixarLog Compression\nHeap-based buffer overflow in tif_pixarlog.c in LibTIFF before 4.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image using the PixarLog Compression format.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff processed certain TIFF images using the Pixar Log Format encoding. An attacker could create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, could cause an application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n\nCVE-2012-3401:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\nThe t2p_read_tiff_init function in tiff2pdf (tools/tiff2pdf.c) in LibTIFF 4.0.2 and earlier does not properly initialize the T2P context struct pointer in certain error conditions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.\n837577: \nCVE-2012-3401 libtiff (tiff2pdf): Heap-based buffer overflow due to improper initialization of T2P context struct pointer\n",
