    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2014-0050:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload handled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart request, causing JBoss Web to enter an infinite loop when processing such an incoming request.\n\nCVE-2013-4322:\n\tIt was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat processed chunk extensions and trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default.\n\nCVE-2013-4286:\n\tIt was found that when Tomcat processed a series of HTTP requests in which at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.\n\nCVE-2012-3544:\n\tIt was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat processed chunk extensions and trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server.
