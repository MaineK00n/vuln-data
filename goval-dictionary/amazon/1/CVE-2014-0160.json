    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2014-0160:\n\t1084875: \nCVE-2014-0160 openssl: information disclosure in handling of TLS heartbeat extension packets\n\nCVE-2013-0169:\n\tThe TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2, as used in OpenSSL, OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products, do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the \"Lucky Thirteen\" issue.\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a padding oracle.\n907589: \nCVE-2013-0169 SSL/TLS: CBC padding timing attack (lucky-13)\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding oracle.\nThis update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.\nThis update fixes several vulnerabilities in the IBM Java Runtime Environment and the IBM Java Software Development Kit. Detailed vulnerability descriptions are linked from the IBM Security alerts page, listed in the References section.\nThis update fixes three vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.\n",
