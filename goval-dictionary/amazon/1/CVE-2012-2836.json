    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-2841:\n\tInteger underflow in the exif_entry_get_value function in exif-entry.c in the EXIF Tag Parsing Library (aka libexif) 0.6.20 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a crafted buffer-size parameter during the formatting of an EXIF tag, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\n839189: \nCVE-2012-2841 libexif: \"exif_entry_get_value()\" integer underflow\nMultiple flaws were found in the way libexif processed Exif tags. An attacker could create a specially-crafted image file that, when opened in an application linked against libexif, could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n\nCVE-2012-2840:\n\tMultiple flaws were found in the way libexif processed Exif tags. An attacker could create a specially-crafted image file that, when opened in an application linked against libexif, could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\nOff-by-one error in the exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8 function in exif-entry.c in the EXIF Tag Parsing Library (aka libexif) before 0.6.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted EXIF tags in an image.\n839188: \nCVE-2012-2840 libexif: \"exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8()\" off-by-one\n\nCVE-2012-2837:\n\tThe mnote_olympus_entry_get_value function in olympus/mnote-olympus-entry.c in the EXIF Tag Parsing Library (aka libexif) before 0.6.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error) via an image with crafted EXIF tags that are not properly handled during the formatting of EXIF maker note tags.\nMultiple flaws were found in the way libexif processed Exif tags.
