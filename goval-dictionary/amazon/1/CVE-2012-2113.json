    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-2113:\n\t810551: \nCVE-2012-2113 libtiff: integer overflow in tiff2pdf leading to heap-buffer overflow when reading a tiled tiff file\nMultiple integer overflows in tiff2pdf in libtiff before 4.0.2 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted tiff image, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2012-2088:\n\t832864: \nCVE-2012-2088 libtiff: Type conversion flaw leading to heap-buffer overflow\nInteger signedness error in the TIFFReadDirectory function in tif_dirread.c in libtiff 3.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative tile depth in a tiff image, which triggers an improper conversion between signed and unsigned types, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\nlibtiff did not properly convert between signed and unsigned integer values, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n",
