    "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-7549:\n\t1549858: \nCVE-2018-7549 zsh: crash on copying empty hash table\nIn params.c in zsh through 5.4.2, there is a crash during a copy of an empty hash table, as demonstrated by typeset -p.\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the code responsible for saving hashtables of the zsh package. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by crashing the user shell.\n\nCVE-2018-1100:\n\t1563395: \nCVE-2018-1100 zsh: buffer overflow in utils.c:checkmailpath() can lead to local arbitrary code execution\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the zsh shell check path functionality. A local, unprivileged user can create a specially crafted message file, which, if used to set a custom \u0026quot;you have new mail\u0026quot; message, leads to code execution in the context of the user who receives the message. If the user affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2018-1083:\n\t1557382: \nCVE-2018-1083 zsh: Stack-based buffer overflow in gen_matches_files() at compctl.c\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the zsh shell auto-complete functionality. A local, unprivileged user can create a specially crafted directory path which leads to code execution in the context of the user who tries to use auto-complete to traverse the before mentioned path. If the user affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2018-1071:\n\t1553531: \nCVE-2018-1071 zsh: Stack-based buffer overflow in exec.c:hashcmd()\nzsh through version 5.4.2 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow in the exec.c:hashcmd() function. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2017-18206:\n\t1549861: \nCVE-2017-18206 zsh: buffer overrun in xsymlinks\nIn utils.c in zsh before 5.4, symlink expansion had a buffer overflow.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the zsh shell symbolic link resolver. A local, unprivileged user can create a specially crafted directory path which leads to a buffer overflow in the context of the user trying to do a symbolic link resolution in the aforementioned path. If the user affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.\n1549861: \nCVE-2017-18206 zsh: buffer overrun in symlinks\n\nCVE-2017-18205:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the code responsible for the cd builtin command of the zsh package. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by crashing the user shell.\n1549862: \nCVE-2017-18205 zsh: NULL dereference in cd in sh compatibility mode under given circumstances\nIn builtin.c in zsh before 5.4, when sh compatibility mode is used, there is a NULL pointer dereference during processing of the cd command with no argument if HOME is not set.\n\nCVE-2014-10072:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw was found in the zsh shell symbolic link resolver. A local, unprivileged user can create a specially crafted directory path which leads to a buffer overflow in the context of the user trying to do symbolic link resolution in the aforementioned path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service condition on the target.\n1549836: \nCVE-2014-10072 zsh: buffer overflow when scanning very long directory paths for symbolic links\n\nCVE-2014-10071:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw was found in the zsh shell file descriptor redirection functionality. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by crashing the user shell.\n1549855: \nCVE-2014-10071 zsh: buffer overflow for very long fds in \u003e\u0026 fd syntax\n",
