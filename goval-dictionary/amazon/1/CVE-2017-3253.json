An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted PNG image could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory.\n\nCVE-2017-3252:\n\tIt was discovered that the JAAS component of OpenJDK did not use the correct way to extract user DN from the result of the user search LDAP query. A specially crafted user LDAP entry could cause the application to use an incorrect DN.\n1413906: \nCVE-2017-3252 OpenJDK: LdapLoginModule incorrect userDN extraction (JAAS, 8161743)\n\nCVE-2017-3241:\n\tIt was discovered that the RMI registry and DCG implementations in the RMI component of OpenJDK performed deserialization of untrusted inputs.
