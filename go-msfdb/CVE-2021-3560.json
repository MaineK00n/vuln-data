  "Title": "Polkit D-Bus Authentication Bypass",
  "Description": "A vulnerability exists within the polkit system service that can be leveraged by a local, unprivileged attacker to perform privileged operations. In order to leverage the vulnerability, the attacker invokes a method over D-Bus and kills the client process. This will occasionally cause the operation to complete without being subjected to all of the necessary authentication. The exploit module leverages this to add a new user with a sudo access and a known password. The new account is then leveraged to execute a payload with root privileges.",
