  "Title": "WebEx UCF atucfobj.dll ActiveX NewObject Method Buffer Overflow",
  "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in WebEx's WebexUCFObject ActiveX Control. If a long string is passed to the 'NewObject' method, a stack- based buffer overflow will occur when copying attacker-supplied data using the sprintf function. It is noteworthy that this vulnerability was discovered and reported by multiple independent researchers. To quote iDefense's advisory, \"Before this issue was publicly reported, at least three independent security researchers had knowledge of this issue; thus, it is reasonable to believe that even more people were aware of this issue before disclosure.\" NOTE: Due to input restrictions, this exploit uses a heap-spray to get the payload into memory unmodified.",
