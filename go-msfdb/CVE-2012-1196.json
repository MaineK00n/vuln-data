The payload is uploaded as an ASP script by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to \"/landesk/managementsuite/core/core.anonymous/ServerSetup.asmx\" , via a \"RunAMTCommand\" operation with the command '-PutUpdateFileCore' as the argument. After execution, the ASP script with the payload is deleted by sending another specially crafted SOAP request to \"WSVulnerabilityCore/VulCore.asmx\" via a \"SetTaskLogByFile\" operation.",
