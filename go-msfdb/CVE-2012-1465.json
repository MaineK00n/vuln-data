  "Title": "NetDecision 4.5.1 HTTP Server Buffer Overflow",
  "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in NetDecision's HTTP service (located in C:\\Program Files\\NetDecision\\Bin\\HttpSvr.exe).  By supplying a long string of data to the URL, an overflow may occur if the data gets handled by HTTP Server's active window.  In other words, in order to gain remote code execution, the victim is probably looking at HttpSvr's window.",
