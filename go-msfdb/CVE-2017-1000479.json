  "Description": "This module exploits a Clickjacking vulnerability in pfSense \u003c= 2.4.1. pfSense is a free and open source firewall and router. It was found that the pfSense WebGUI is vulnerable to Clickjacking. By tricking an authenticated admin into interacting with a specially crafted webpage it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the WebGUI.
