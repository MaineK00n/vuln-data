  "Description": "This module allows an attacker with a privileged Wordpress account to launch a reverse shell due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Wordpress plugin Modern Events Calendar \u003c 5.16.5. This is due to an incorrect check of the uploaded file extension. Indeed, by using `text/csv` content-type in a request, it is possible to upload a .php payload as is is not forbidden by the plugin. Finally, the uploaded payload can be triggered by a call to `/wp-content/uploads/\u003crandom_payload_name\u003e.php`",
