  "Name": "phpmyadmin_config.rb",
  "Title": "PhpMyAdmin Config File Code Injection",
  "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin's setup feature which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into a configuration file. The original advisory says the vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 2.11.x \u003c 2.11.9.5 and 3.x \u003c 3.1.3.1; this module was tested on 3.0.1.1. The file where our payload is written (phpMyAdmin/config/config.inc.php) is not directly used by the system, so it may be a good idea to either delete it or copy the running config (phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php) over it after successful exploitation.",
