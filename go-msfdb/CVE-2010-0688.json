  "Title": "Orbital Viewer ORB File Parsing Buffer Overflow",
  "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in David Manthey's Orbital Viewer. When processing .ORB files, data is read from file into a fixed-size stack buffer using the fscanf function. Since no bounds checking is done, a buffer overflow can occur. Attackers can execute arbitrary code by convincing their victim to open an ORB file.",
