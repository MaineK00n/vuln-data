  "Title": "Mutiny 5 Arbitrary File Upload",
  "Description": "This module exploits a code execution flaw in the Mutiny 5 appliance. The EditDocument servlet provides a file upload function to authenticated users. A directory traversal vulnerability in the same functionality allows for arbitrary file upload, which results in arbitrary code execution with root privileges. In order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role) in the web frontend is required. The module has been tested successfully on the Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.",
