  "Description": "This module can be used to execute a payload on JBoss servers that have an exposed \"jmx-console\" application. The payload is put on the server by using the jboss.system:MainDeployer functionality. To accomplish this, a temporary HTTP server is created to serve a WAR archive containing our payload. This method will only work if the target server allows outbound connections to us.",
