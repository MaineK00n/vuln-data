  "Title": "Apple QuickTime 7.6.7 _Marshaled_pUnk Code Execution",
  "Description": "This module exploits a memory trust issue in Apple QuickTime 7.6.7. When processing a specially-crafted HTML page, the QuickTime ActiveX control will treat a supplied parameter as a trusted pointer. It will then use it as a COM-type pUnknown and lead to arbitrary code execution. This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the QuickTimeAuthoring.qtx module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows versions. NOTE: The addresses may need to be adjusted for older versions of QuickTime.",
