  "Title": "Hak5 WiFi Pineapple Preconfiguration Command Injection",
  "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on WiFi Pineapples version 2.0 \u003c= pineapple \u003c 2.4. We use a combination of default credentials with a weakness in the anti-csrf generation to achieve command injection on fresh pineapple devices prior to configuration. Additionally if default credentials fail, you can enable a brute force solver for the proof-of-ownership challenge. This will reset the password to a known password if successful and may interrupt the user experience. These devices may typically be identified by their SSID beacons of 'Pineapple5_....'; details derived from the TospoVirus, a WiFi Pineapple infecting worm.",
