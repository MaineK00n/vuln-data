  "Title": "Java Applet Driver Manager Privileged toString() Remote Code Execution",
  "Description": "This module abuses the java.sql.DriverManager class where the toString() method is called over user supplied classes from a doPrivileged block. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u17 and earlier. This exploit bypasses click-to-play on Internet Explorer and throws a specially crafted JNLP file. This bypass is applicable mainly to IE, where Java Web Start can be launched automatically through the ActiveX control. Otherwise, the applet is launched without click-to-play bypass.",
