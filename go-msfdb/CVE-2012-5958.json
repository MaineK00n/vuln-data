  "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in the unique_service_name() function of libupnp's SSDP processor. The libupnp library is used across thousands of devices and is referred to as the Intel SDK for UPnP Devices or the Portable SDK for UPnP Devices. Due to size limitations on many devices, this exploit uses a separate TCP listener to stage the real payload.",
