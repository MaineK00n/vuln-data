  "Title": "Wordpress Plugin SP Project and Document - Authenticated Remote Code Execution",
  "Description": "This module allows an attacker with a privileged Wordpress account to launch a reverse shell due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Wordpress plugin SP Project \u0026 Document \u003c 4.22. The security check only searches for lowercase file extensions such as `.php`, making it possible to upload `.pHP` files for instance. Finally, the uploaded payload can be triggered by a call to `/wp-content/uploads/sp-client-document-manager/\u003cuser_id\u003e/\u003crandom_payload_name\u003e.php`",
