  "Description": "This module logs in to a GlassFish Server (Open Source or Commercial) using various methods (such as authentication bypass, default credentials, or user-supplied login), and deploys a malicious war file in order to get remote code execution. It has been tested on Glassfish 2.x, 3.0, 4.0 and Sun Java System Application Server 9.x. Newer GlassFish versions do not allow remote access (Secure Admin) by default, but is required for exploitation.",
