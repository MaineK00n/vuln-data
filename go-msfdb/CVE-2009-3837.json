  "Title": "Eureka Email 2.2q ERR Remote Buffer Overflow",
  "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in the Eureka Email 2.2q client that is triggered through an excessively long ERR message. NOTE: this exploit isn't very reliable. Unfortunately reaching the vulnerable code can only be done when manually checking mail (Ctrl-M). Checking at startup will not reach the code targeted here.",
