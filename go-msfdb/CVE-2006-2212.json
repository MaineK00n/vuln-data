  "Title": "KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server v2.0.2 USER Overflow",
  "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated stack buffer overflow in KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server version 2.0.2 by sending an overly long USER string during login. The payload is triggered when the administrator opens the application GUI. If the GUI window is open at the time of exploitation, the payload will be executed immediately. Keep this in mind when selecting payloads. The application will crash following execution of the payload and will not restart automatically. When the application is restarted, it will re-execute the payload unless the payload has been manually removed from the SamiFTP.binlog log file. This module has been tested successfully on Sami FTP Server versions: 2.0.2 on Windows XP SP0 (x86); 2.0.2 on Windows 7 SP1 (x86); 2.0.2 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64); and 2.0.2 on Windows 10 (1909) (x64).",
