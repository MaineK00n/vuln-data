  "Title": "Moxa UDP Device Discovery",
  "Description": "The Moxa protocol listens on 4800/UDP and will respond to broadcast or direct traffic.  The service is known to be used on Moxa devices in the NPort, OnCell, and MGate product lines. A discovery packet compels a Moxa device to respond to the sender with some basic device information that is needed for more advanced functions.  The discovery data is 8 bytes in length and is the most basic example of the Moxa protocol.  It may be sent out as a broadcast (destination 255.255.255.255) or to an individual device. Devices that respond to this query may be vulnerable to serious information disclosure vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2016-9361. The module is the work of Patrick DeSantis of Cisco Talos and is derived from original work by K. Reid Wightman. Tested and validated on a Moxa NPort 6250 with firmware versions 1.13 and 1.15.",
