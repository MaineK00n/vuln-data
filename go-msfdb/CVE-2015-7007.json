  "Title": "Safari User-Assisted Applescript Exec Attack",
  "Description": "In versions of Mac OS X before 10.11.1, the applescript:// URL scheme is provided, which opens the provided script in the Applescript Editor. Pressing cmd-R in the Editor executes the code without any additional confirmation from the user. By getting the user to press cmd-R in Safari, and by hooking the cmd-key keypress event, a user can be tricked into running arbitrary Applescript code. Gatekeeper should be disabled from Security \u0026 Privacy in order to avoid the unidentified Developer prompt.",
