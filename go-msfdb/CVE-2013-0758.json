  "Title": "Firefox 17.0.1 Flash Privileged Code Injection",
  "Description": "This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 17 and 17.0.1, provided the user has installed Flash. No memory corruption is used. First, a Flash object is cloned into the anonymous content of the SVG \"use\" element in the \u003cbody\u003e (CVE-2013-0758). From there, the Flash object can navigate a child frame to a URL in the chrome:// scheme. Then a separate exploit (CVE-2013-0757) is used to bypass the security wrapper around the child frame's window reference and inject code into the chrome:// context. Once we have injection into the chrome execution context, we can write the payload to disk, chmod it (if posix), and then execute. Note: Flash is used here to trigger the exploit but any Firefox plugin with script access should be able to trigger it.",
