  "Title": "HP Data Protector DtbClsLogin Buffer Overflow",
  "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP Data Protector 4.0 SP1. The overflow occurs during the login process, in the DtbClsLogin function provided by the dpwindtb.dll component, where the Utf8Cpy (strcpy like function) is used in an insecure way with the username. A successful exploitation will lead to code execution with the privileges of the \"dpwinsdr.exe\" (HP Data Protector Express Domain Server Service) process, which runs as SYSTEM by default.",
