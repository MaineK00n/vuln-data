  "Title": "Drupal RESTful Web Services unserialize() RCE",
  "Description": "This module exploits a PHP unserialize() vulnerability in Drupal RESTful Web Services by sending a crafted request to the /node REST endpoint. As per SA-CORE-2019-003, the initial remediation was to disable POST, PATCH, and PUT, but Ambionics discovered that GET was also vulnerable (albeit cached). Cached nodes can be exploited only once. Drupal updated SA-CORE-2019-003 with PSA-2019-02-22 to notify users of this alternate vector. Drupal \u003c 8.5.11 and \u003c 8.6.10 are vulnerable.",
