  "Title": "Solaris ypupdated Command Execution",
  "Description": "This exploit targets a weakness in the way the ypupdated RPC application uses the command shell when handling a MAP UPDATE request.  Extra commands may be launched through this command shell, which runs as root on the remote host, by passing commands in the format '|\u003ccommand\u003e'. Vulnerable systems include Solaris 2.7, 8, 9, and 10, when ypupdated is started with the '-i' command-line option.",
