  "Title": "Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) Browser UXSS",
  "Description": "This module exploits a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability present in all versions of Android's open source stock browser before 4.4, and Android apps running on \u003c 4.4 that embed the WebView component. If successful, an attacker can leverage this bug to scrape both cookie data and page contents from a vulnerable browser window. If your target URLs use X-Frame-Options, you can enable the \"BYPASS_XFO\" option, which will cause a popup window to be used. This requires a click from the user and is much less stealthy, but is generally harmless-looking. By supplying a CUSTOM_JS parameter and ensuring CLOSE_POPUP is set to false, this module also allows running aribtrary javascript in the context of the targeted URL. Some sample UXSS scripts are provided in data/exploits/uxss.",
