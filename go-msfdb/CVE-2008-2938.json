  "Description": "This module tests whether a directory traversal vulnerablity is present in Trend Micro DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Appliance v5.5 build \u003c= 1294. The vulnerability appears to be actually caused by the Tomcat UTF-8 bug which is implemented in module tomcat_utf8_traversal CVE 2008-2938. This module simply tests for the same bug with Trend Micro specific settings. Note that in the Trend Micro appliance, /etc/shadow is not used and therefore password hashes are stored and anonymously accessible in the passwd file.",
