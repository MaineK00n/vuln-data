  "CveID": "CVE-2006-2656",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the tiffsplit command in libtiff 3.8.2 and earlier might might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: tiffsplit is not setuid.  If there is not a common scenario under which tiffsplit is called with attacker-controlled command line arguments, then perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.",
