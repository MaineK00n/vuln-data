  "CveID": "CVE-2017-12374",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations on bounce messages). If successfully exploited, the ClamAV software could allow a variable pointing to the mail body which could cause a used after being free (use-after-free) instance which may lead to a disruption of services on an affected device to include a denial of service condition.",
