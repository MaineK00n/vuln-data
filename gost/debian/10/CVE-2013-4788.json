  "CveID": "CVE-2013-4788",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The PTR_MANGLE implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.4, 2.17, and earlier, and Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) does not initialize the random value for the pointer guard, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to control execution flow by leveraging a buffer-overflow vulnerability in an application and using the known zero value pointer guard to calculate a pointer address.",
  "Package": [

      "PackageName": "glibc",
      "Release": [
        {
          "ProductName": "buster",
