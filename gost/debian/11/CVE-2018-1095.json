  "CveID": "CVE-2018-1095",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The ext4_xattr_check_entries function in fs/ext4/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 does not properly validate xattr sizes, which causes misinterpretation of a size as an error code, and consequently allows attackers to cause a denial of service (get_acl NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted ext4 image.",
