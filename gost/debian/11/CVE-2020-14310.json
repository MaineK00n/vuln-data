  "CveID": "CVE-2020-14310",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at function read_section_as_string(). It expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX - 1 length in bytes but it doesn't verify it before proceed with buffer allocation to read the value from the font value. An attacker may leverage that by crafting a malicious font file which has a name with UINT32_MAX, leading to read_section_as_string() to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sized allocation and further heap-based buffer overflow.",
