  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The default configuration of logrotate on Debian GNU/Linux uses root privileges to process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories, as demonstrated by /var/log/postgresql/.",
