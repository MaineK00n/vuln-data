  "CveID": "CVE-2012-3375",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The epoll_ctl system call in fs/eventpoll.c in the Linux kernel before 3.2.24 does not properly handle ELOOP errors in EPOLL_CTL_ADD operations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (file-descriptor consumption and system crash) via a crafted application that attempts to create a circular epoll dependency.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-1083.",
