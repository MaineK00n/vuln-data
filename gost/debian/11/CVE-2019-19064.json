  "CveID": "CVE-2019-19064",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the fsl_lpspi_probe() function in drivers/spi/spi-fsl-lpspi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering pm_runtime_get_sync() failures, aka CID-057b8945f78f. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because an attacker cannot realistically control these failures at probe time.",
