{
  "CveID": "CVE-2021-36367",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "PuTTY through 0.75 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has never sent a substantive authentication response. This makes it easier for an attacker-controlled SSH server to present a later spoofed authentication prompt (that the attacker can use to capture credential data, and use that data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).",

        {
          "ProductName": "bullseye",
