  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in GnuTLS before 3.6.15. A server can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in a TLS 1.3 client if a no_renegotiation alert is sent with unexpected timing, and then an invalid second handshake occurs. The crash happens in the application's error handling path, where the gnutls_deinit function is called after detecting a handshake failure.",
