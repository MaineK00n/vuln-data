  "CveID": "CVE-2017-17520",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** tools/url_handler.pl in TIN 2.4.1 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a third party has reported that this is intentional behavior, because the documentation states \"url_handler.pl was designed to work together with tin which only issues shell escaped absolute URLs.\"",
