  "CveID": "CVE-2019-9812",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading accounts.firefox.com in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 60.9, Firefox ESR \u003c 68.1, and Firefox \u003c 69.",
