  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Symfony before 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5, and 4.0-BETA5. The current implementation of CSRF protection in Symfony (Version \u003e=2) does not use different tokens for HTTP and HTTPS; therefore the token is subject to MITM attacks on HTTP and can then be used in an HTTPS context to do CSRF attacks.",
