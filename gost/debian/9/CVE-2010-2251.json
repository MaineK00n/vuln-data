  "CveID": "CVE-2010-2251",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The get1 command, as used by lftpget, in LFTP before 4.0.6 does not properly validate a server-provided filename before determining the destination filename of a download, which allows remote servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a Content-Disposition header that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home directory.",

    {
      "PackageName": "lftp",
      "Release": [
        {
          "ProductName": "stretch",
          "Status": "resolved",
