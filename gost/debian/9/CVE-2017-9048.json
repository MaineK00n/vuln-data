  "CveID": "CVE-2017-9048",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. At the end of the routine, the function may strcat two more characters without checking whether the current strlen(buf) + 2 \u003c size. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.",
