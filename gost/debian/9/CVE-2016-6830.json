  "CveID": "CVE-2016-6830",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The \"process-execute\" and \"process-spawn\" procedures in CHICKEN Scheme used fixed-size buffers for holding the arguments and environment variables to use in its execve() call. This would allow user-supplied argument/environment variable lists to trigger a buffer overrun. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).",
