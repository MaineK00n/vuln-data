  "CveID": "CVE-2012-5370",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "JRuby computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated by a universal multicollision attack against the MurmurHash2 algorithm, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4838.",
