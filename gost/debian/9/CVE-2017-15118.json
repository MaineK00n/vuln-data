  "CveID": "CVE-2017-15118",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in NBD server implementation in qemu before 2.11 allowing a client to request an export name of size up to 4096 bytes, which in fact should be limited to 256 bytes, causing an out-of-bounds stack write in the qemu process. If NBD server requires TLS, the attacker cannot trigger the buffer overflow without first successfully negotiating TLS.",
