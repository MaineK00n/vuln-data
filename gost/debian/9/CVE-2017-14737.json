  "CveID": "CVE-2017-14737",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "A cryptographic cache-based side channel in the RSA implementation in Botan before 1.10.17, and 1.11.x and 2.x before 2.3.0, allows a local attacker to recover information about RSA secret keys, as demonstrated by CacheD. This occurs because an array is indexed with bits derived from a secret key.",
