  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "In MediaWiki before 1.31.10 and 1.32.x through 1.34.x before 1.34.4, XSS related to jQuery can occur. The attacker creates a message with [javascript:payload xss] and turns it into a jQuery object with mw.message().parse(). The expected result is that the jQuery object does not contain an \u003ca\u003e tag (or it does not have a href attribute, or it's empty, etc.). The actual result is that the object contains an \u003ca href =\"javascript... that executes when clicked.",
