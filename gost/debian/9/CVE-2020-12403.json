  "CveID": "CVE-2020-12403",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS in versions before 3.55. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads. This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and system availability.",
