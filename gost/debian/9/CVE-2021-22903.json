  "CveID": "CVE-2021-22903",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The actionpack ruby gem before 6.1.3.2 suffers from a possible open redirect vulnerability. Specially crafted Host headers in combination with certain \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. This is similar to CVE-2021-22881. Strings in config.hosts that do not have a leading dot are converted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This causes, for example, `config.hosts \u003c\u003c \"sub.example.com\"` to permit a request with a Host header value of `sub-example.com`.",
