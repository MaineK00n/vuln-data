  "CveID": "CVE-2018-16874",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "In Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3, the \"go get\" command is vulnerable to directory traversal when executed with the import path of a malicious Go package which contains curly braces (both '{' and '}' characters). Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). The attacker can cause an arbitrary filesystem write, which can lead to code execution.",
