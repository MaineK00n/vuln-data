  "CveID": "CVE-2016-6831",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The \"process-execute\" and \"process-spawn\" procedures did not free memory correctly when the execve() call failed, resulting in a memory leak. This could be abused by an attacker to cause resource exhaustion or a denial of service. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).",
