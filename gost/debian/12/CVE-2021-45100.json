  "CveID": "CVE-2021-45100",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The ksmbd server through 3.4.2, as used in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8, sometimes communicates in cleartext even though encryption has been enabled. This occurs because it sets the SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION flag when using the SMB 3.1.1 protocol, which is a violation of the SMB protocol specification. When Windows 10 detects this protocol violation, it disables encryption.",
