  "CveID": "CVE-2021-28878",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "In the standard library in Rust before 1.52.0, the Zip implementation calls __iterator_get_unchecked() more than once for the same index (under certain conditions) when next_back() and next() are used together. This bug could lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.",
