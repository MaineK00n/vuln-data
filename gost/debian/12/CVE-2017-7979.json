  "Description": "The cookie feature in the packet action API implementation in net/sched/act_api.c in the Linux kernel 4.11.x through 4.11-rc7 mishandles the tb nlattr array, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and refcount underflow, and system hang or crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via \"tc filter add\" commands in certain contexts. NOTE: this does not affect stable kernels, such as 4.10.x, from kernel.org.",
