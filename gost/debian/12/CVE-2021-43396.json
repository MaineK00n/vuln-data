  "CveID": "CVE-2021-43396",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** In iconvdata/iso-2022-jp-3.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) 2.34, remote attackers can force iconv() to emit a spurious '\\0' character via crafted ISO-2022-JP-3 data that is accompanied by an internal state reset. This may affect data integrity in certain iconv() use cases. NOTE: the vendor states \"the bug cannot be invoked through user input and requires iconv to be invoked with a NULL inbuf, which ought to require a separate application bug to do so unintentionally. Hence there's no security impact to the bug.\"",
