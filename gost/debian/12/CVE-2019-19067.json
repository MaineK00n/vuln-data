  "CveID": "CVE-2019-19067",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Four memory leaks in the acp_hw_init() function in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acp.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.8 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering mfd_add_hotplug_devices() or pm_genpd_add_device() failures, aka CID-57be09c6e874. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because the attacker must already have privileges for module loading.",
