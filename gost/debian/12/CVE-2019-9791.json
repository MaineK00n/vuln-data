{
  "CveID": "CVE-2019-9791",
  "Scope": "local",
  "Description": "The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60.6, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.6, and Firefox \u003c 66.",
