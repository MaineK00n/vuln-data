  "Statement": "The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact.  By default, /var/spool/mail/ is not provided with permissions to make an attack scenario possible, and there is no reason for permissions to be relaxed in such a way as to make it possible.  We therefore have no plans to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5.",
