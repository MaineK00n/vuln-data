  "Statement": "Preventing a user from accessing the system without deleting their account is not a simple matter. For utmost security, the account should be deleted. Short of this, we recommend a three-pronged approach:\n* change the user's login shell to a harmless command that is not in \"/etc/shells\" (for example \"/bin/false\") to prevent commands being run on their behalf\n* lock the user's password with \"usermod -L\" to prevent authentication with pam services\n* prevent access to the user's home directory with \"chmod 0\" or \"chown root\" and \"chmod 700\" to prevent authentication with ssh keys etc",
