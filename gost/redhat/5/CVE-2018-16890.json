  "Statement": "The versions of curl package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 do not support NTLMv2 type-2 headers, hence they are not affected by this flaw.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Stenberg (the Curl project) for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Wenxiang Qian (Tencent Blade Team) as the original reporter.",
  "Mitigation": "Turn off NTLM authentication.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read. The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability. Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer read out-of-bounds."

    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way curl handled NTLMv2 type-2 headers. When connecting to a remote malicious server which uses NTLM authentication, the flaw could cause curl to crash."
