    {
      "Detail": "The arcmsr_iop_message_xfer function in drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr_hba.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 does not restrict a certain length field, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) via an ARCMSR_MESSAGE_WRITE_WQBUFFER control code."

    {
      "Detail": "A heap-buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the arcmsr_iop_message_xfer() function in 'drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr_hba.c' file in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2. The function does not restrict a certain length field, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service via an ARCMSR_MESSAGE_WRITE_WQBUFFER control code. This can potentially cause kernel heap corruption and arbitrary kernel code execution."
