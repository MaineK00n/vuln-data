  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The check_alu_op function in kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 4.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging incorrect sign extension."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An arbitrary memory r/w access issue was found in the Linux kernel compiled with the eBPF bpf(2) system call (CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL) support. The issue could occur due to calculation errors in the eBPF verifier module, triggered by user supplied malicious BPF program. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on a system. Setting parameter \"kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1\" prevents such privilege escalation by restricting access to bpf(2) call."
