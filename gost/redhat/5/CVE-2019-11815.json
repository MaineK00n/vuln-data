    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in rds_tcp_kill_sock in net/rds/tcp.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.8. There is a race condition leading to a use-after-free, related to net namespace cleanup."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDS over TCP. A system that has the rds_tcp kernel module loaded (either through autoload via local process running listen(), or manual loading) could possibly cause a use after free (UAF) in which an attacker who is able to manipulate socket state while a network namespace is being torn down. This can lead to possible memory corruption and privilege escalation."
