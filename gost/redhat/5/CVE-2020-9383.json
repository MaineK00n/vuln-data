  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is to skip loading the affected floppy driver module onto the system till we have a fix available, this can be done by a blacklist mechanism, this will ensure the driver is not loaded at the boot time.\n~~~\nHow do I blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically?\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 \n~~~",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.5.6. set_fdc in drivers/block/floppy.c leads to a wait_til_ready out-of-bounds read because the FDC index is not checked for errors before assigning it, aka CID-2e90ca68b0d2."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the floppy driver module in the Linux kernel. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
