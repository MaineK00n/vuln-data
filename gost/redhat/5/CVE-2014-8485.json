  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The setup_group function in bfd/elf.c in libbfd in GNU binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted section group headers in an ELF file."

      "Detail": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way various binutils utilities processed certain files. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, it could cause the utility used to process that file to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that utility."
