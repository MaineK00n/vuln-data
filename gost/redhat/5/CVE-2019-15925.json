  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2.3. An out of bounds access exists in the function hclge_tm_schd_mode_vnet_base_cfg in the file drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns3/hns3pf/hclge_tm.c."

    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the hclge_shaper_para_calc driver in the Linux kernel. Access to an array with an index higher than its maximum index will lead to an out-of-bounds access vulnerability. This could affect both data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
