  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "python_scripts.py in Plone before 4.2.3 and 4.3 before beta 1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value, related to formatColumns."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly handle the processing of very large values passed to an internal utility function. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would lead to excessive memory consumption."
