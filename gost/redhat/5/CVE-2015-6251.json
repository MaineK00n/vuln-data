    {
      "Detail": "Double free vulnerability in GnuTLS before 3.3.17 and 3.4.x before 3.4.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a long DistinguishedName (DN) entry in a certificate."

      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in GnuTLS's _gnutls_x509_dn_to_string() function. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted certificate with very long DistinguishedName (DN) entries that, when processed by an application compiled against GnuTLS, could cause that application to crash."
