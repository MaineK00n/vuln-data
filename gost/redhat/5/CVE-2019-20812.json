  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.4.7. The prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo() function in net/packet/af_packet.c can result in a denial of service (CPU consumption and soft lockup) in a certain failure case involving TPACKET_V3, aka CID-b43d1f9f7067."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way the af_packet functionality in the Linux kernel handled the retirement timer setting for TPACKET_v3 when getting settings from the underlying network device errors out. This flaw allows a local user who can open the af_packet domain socket and who can hit the error path, to use this vulnerability to starve the system."
