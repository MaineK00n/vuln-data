  "Statement": "This issue affects the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not provide support for CLONE_IO. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they already contain the fix. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0481.html.",
