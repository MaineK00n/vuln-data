  "Mitigation": "Preventing loading of the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system; however, the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See the kcs “How do I blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically?“  (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module from autoloading. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly.\nThis mitigation may not be suitable if the graphical login functionality is required.",

      "Detail": "The fix for the Linux kernel in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for CVE-2019-14615 (\"The Linux kernel did not properly clear data structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors.\") was discovered to be incomplete, meaning that in versions of the kernel before 4.15.0-91.92, an attacker could use this vulnerability to expose sensitive information."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An information disclosure flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The original fix for CVE-2019-14615 was deemed to be incomplete. The i915 graphics driver lacks control of flow for data structures which may allow a local, authenticated user to disclose information when using ioctl commands with an attached i915 device. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
