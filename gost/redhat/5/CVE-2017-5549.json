  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The klsi_105_get_line_state function in drivers/usb/serial/kl5kusb105.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.5 places uninitialized heap-memory contents into a log entry upon a failure to read the line status, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log."

      "Detail": "It was found that current implementation of kl5kusb105 driver failed to detect short transfers when attempting to read the line state and logged the content of the uninitialized heap transfer buffer."
