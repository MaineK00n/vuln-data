  "Cwe": "CWE-287",
  "Statement": "If HTTP is enabled (e.g. RSS, CalDAV), cyrus-imapd does not properly authenticate a HTTP request coming through a connection that has been previously authenticated. Usually, this is not a problem, as each user will have their own connection and a breach of security boundaries would not be possible. An exception to this rule is if the cyrus-imapd HTTP service is behind a proxy, for example a reverse caching proxy, and said proxy reuses the same connection to cyrus-imapd for multiple requests.",
