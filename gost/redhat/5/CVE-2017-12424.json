    {
      "Detail": "In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A buffer overflow flaw leading to heap memory corruption was found in the shadow-utils's newusers utility. A local, authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash the newusers process by supplying crafted data to it."
