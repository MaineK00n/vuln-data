  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "QEMU 5.0.0 has a heap-based Buffer Overflow in flatview_read_continue in exec.c because hw/sd/sdhci.c mishandles a write operation in the SDHC_BLKSIZE case."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in QEMU. An out-of-bounds read/write access issue was found in the SDHCI Controller emulator of QEMU. It may occur while doing multi block SDMA, if transfer block size exceeds the 's-\u003efifo_buffer[s-\u003ebuf_maxsz]' size which would leave the current element pointer 's-\u003edata_count' pointing out of bounds. This would lead the subsequent DMA r/w operation to an OOB access issue where a guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS scenario. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
