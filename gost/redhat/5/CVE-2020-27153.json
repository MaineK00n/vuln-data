  "Statement": "",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Jay LV (antgroup) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "This flaw can be mitigated by only connecting the gatttool client to trusted GATT servers/devices. The flaw is in the service discovery which occurs after a Bluetoth Low Energy (BLE) connection has been established to a device. A secondary mitigation for this flaw is to disable bluetooth.  Instructions on disabling bluetooth in Red Hat Enterprise Linux are available at: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2682931",

      "Detail": "In BlueZ before 5.55, a double free was found in the gatttool disconnect_cb() routine from shared/att.c. A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or code execution, during service discovery, due to a redundant disconnect MGMT event."
