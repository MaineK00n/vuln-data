  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The arch_dup_task_struct function in the Transactional Memory (TM) implementation in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13.7 on the powerpc platform does not properly interact with the clone and fork system calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (Program Check and system crash) via certain instructions that are executed with the processor in the Transactional state."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel performed forking inside of a transaction. A local, unprivileged user on a PowerPC system that supports transactional memory could use this flaw to crash the system."
