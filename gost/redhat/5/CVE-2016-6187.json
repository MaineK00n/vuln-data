  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The apparmor_setprocattr function in security/apparmor/lsm.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.5 does not validate the buffer size, which allows local users to gain privileges by triggering an AppArmor setprocattr hook."

    {
      "Detail": "A vulnerability leading to a local privilege escalation was found in apparmor in the Linux kernel. When proc_pid_attr_write() was changed to use memdup_user apparmor's (interface violating) assumption that the setprocattr buffer was always a single page was violated."
