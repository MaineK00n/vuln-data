  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel before 5.1.13, there is a memory leak in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c when SAS expander discovery fails. This will cause a BUG and denial of service."

    {
      "Detail": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel. An error in the resource cleanup of the sas_ex_discover_expander function can allow an attacker to induce error conditions that could crash the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
