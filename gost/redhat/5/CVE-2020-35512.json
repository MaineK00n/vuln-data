  "Statement": "Regarding the concern with D-Bus, users with the same UID are treated as the same user. As in Linux, multiple assumptions are made based on the fact that a user is identified by its UID. It is not advisable to have multiple users with different privileges and the same UID on systems where D-Bus is used. For these reasons, this vulnerability has been rated as having Low Impact.",

      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in D-Bus Development branch \u003c= 1.13.16, dbus-1.12.x stable branch \u003c= 1.12.18, and dbus-1.10.x and older branches \u003c= 1.10.30 when a system has multiple usernames sharing the same UID. When a set of policy rules references these usernames, D-Bus may free some memory in the heap, which is still used by data structures necessary for the other usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined behaviors"
