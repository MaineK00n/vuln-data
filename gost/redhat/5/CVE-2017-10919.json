  "Mitigation": "\nOn systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than\nguest administrator, running only kernels which do not disable SGI and\nPPI (i.e IRQ \u003c 32) will prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting\nthis issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it\nunless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into\nthe kernel (e.g by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other\nmechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.\n    ",
