  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "tcsd in TrouSerS before 0.3.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted type_offset value in a TCP packet to port 30003."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way tcsd, the daemon that manages Trusted Computing resources, processed incoming TCP packets. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted TCP packet that, when processed by tcsd, could cause the daemon to crash. Note that by default tcsd accepts requests on localhost only."
