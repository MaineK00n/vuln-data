  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The tipc_nl_publ_dump function in net/tipc/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6 does not verify socket existence, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a dumpit operation."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. The pointer to the netlink socket attribute is not checked, which could cause a null pointer dereference when parsing the nested attributes in function tipc_nl_publ_dump(). This allows local users to cause a DoS."
