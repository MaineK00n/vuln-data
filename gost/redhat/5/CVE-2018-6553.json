    {
      "Detail": "The CUPS AppArmor profile incorrectly confined the dnssd backend due to use of hard links. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to escape confinement. This flaw affects versions prior to 2.2.7-1ubuntu2.1 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, prior to 2.2.4-7ubuntu3.1 in Ubuntu 17.10, prior to 2.1.3-4ubuntu0.5 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and prior to 1.7.2-0ubuntu1.10 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS."

    {
      "Detail": "An AppArmor sandbox bypass has been discovered in cups due to the use of hard links which are not covered by the AppArmor profile. An attacker could use the hard link, if it exists, to execute the referenced backend without sandbox restrictions."
