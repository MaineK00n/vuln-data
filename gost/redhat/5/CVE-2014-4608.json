  "Statement": "This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 only support 64-bit architectures. Since exploiting this issue on 64-bit platforms is not feasible given the amount of input data that is necessary to trigger the integer overflow, we are currently not planning planning to fix this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.",

      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** Multiple integer overflows in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function in lib/lzo/lzo1x_decompress_safe.c in the LZO decompressor in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted Literal Run.  NOTE: the author of the LZO algorithms says \"the Linux kernel is *not* affected; media hype.\""

      "Detail": "An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the lzo1x_decompress_safe() function of the Linux kernel's LZO implementation processed Literal Runs. A local attacker could, in extremely rare cases, use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system."
