    {
      "Detail": "A memory leak in the ql_alloc_large_buffers() function in drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qla3xxx.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering pci_dma_mapping_error() failures, aka CID-1acb8f2a7a9f."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way the QLogic QLA3xxx NIC HBA Driver in the Linux kernel handled resource cleanup on a DMA mapping error. This flaw allows an attacker able to trigger the DMA mapping error to crash the system."
