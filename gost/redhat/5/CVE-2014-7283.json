  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The xfs_da3_fixhashpath function in fs/xfs/xfs_da_btree.c in the xfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.14.2 does not properly compare btree hash values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (filesystem corruption, and OOPS or panic) via operations on directories that have hash collisions, as demonstrated by rmdir operations."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's XFS file system implementation ordered directory hashes under certain conditions. A local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the file system by creating directories with colliding hash values, potentially resulting in a system crash."
