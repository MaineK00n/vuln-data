  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The NetKVM Windows Virtio driver allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (guest crash) via a crafted length value in an IP packet, as demonstrated by a value that does not account for the size of the IP options."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that the Windows Virtio NIC driver did not sufficiently sanitize the length of the incoming IP packets, as demonstrated by a packet with IP options present but the overall packet length not being adjusted to reflect the length of those options. A remote attacker able to send a specially crafted IP packet to the guest could use this flaw to crash that guest."
