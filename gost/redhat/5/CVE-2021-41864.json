  "Statement": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.\nA kernel update will be required to mitigate the flaw for the root or users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write."

    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the bpf in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, the multiplication to calculate the size could lead to an integer overflow which could allow a local attacker, with a special user privilege, to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information."
