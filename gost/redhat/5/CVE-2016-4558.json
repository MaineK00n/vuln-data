    {
      "Detail": "The BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.5.5 mishandles reference counts, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application on (1) a system with more than 32 Gb of memory, related to the program reference count or (2) a 1 Tb system, related to the map reference count."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of BPF in which systems can application can overflow a 32 bit refcount in both program and map refcount.  This refcount can wrap and end up a user after free."
