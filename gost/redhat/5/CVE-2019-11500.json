  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In Dovecot before 2.2.36.4 and 2.3.x before 2.3.7.2 (and Pigeonhole before 0.5.7.2), protocol processing can fail for quoted strings. This occurs because '\\0' characters are mishandled, and can lead to out-of-bounds writes and remote code execution."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in dovecot. IMAP and ManageSieve protocol parsers do not properly handle the NULL byte when scanning data in quoted strings which leads to an out of bounds heap memory write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
