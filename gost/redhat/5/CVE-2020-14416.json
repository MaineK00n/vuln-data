  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is to skip loading the affected module 'slcan' and 'slip' onto the system until a fix is available. Using a blacklist mechanism will ensure the driver is not loaded at boot time and requires specific hardware (CANbus hardware), which is not in use on the system.\n~~~\nHow do I blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically?\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel before 5.4.16, a race condition in tty-\u003edisc_data handling in the slip and slcan line discipline could lead to a use-after-free, aka CID-0ace17d56824. This affects drivers/net/slip/slip.c and drivers/net/can/slcan.c."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in slcan_write_wakeup in drivers/net/can/slcan.c in the serial CAN module slcan. A race condition occurs when communicating with can using slcan between the write (scheduling the transmit) and closing (flushing out any pending queues) the SLCAN channel. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user or root privileges to cause a denial of service or a kernel information leak. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
