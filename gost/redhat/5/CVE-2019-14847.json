  "Statement": "This flaw does not affect the version of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux because there is no support for samba as Active Directory Domain Controller.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Adam Xu as the original reporter.",
  "Mitigation": "By default, the supported versions of Samba impacted by this issue run using the \"standard\" process model, which is unaffected. This is controlled by the -M or --model parameter to the samba binary. Unsupported Samba versions before Samba 4.7 use a single process for the LDAP server, and so are impacted. Samba 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10 are impacted if -M prefork or -M single is used. To mitigate this issue, select -M standard (the default).",
