  "Statement": "Red Hat Product Security does not consider this to be a vulnerability in a Red Hat product as this issue resides in Ubuntu specific patch.\nMoreover, the described problem that ppp daemon can load module ppp_generic on startup, and this considered to be potentially dangerous, because user can install fake ppp_generic module instead of real. However, only user with high privileges can install new ppp_generic module to correct path for modprobe, so if user have high privileges, then he can load any module he wants anyway.",
