      "Detail": "curl, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 before version 7.19.7-53, did not correctly backport the fix for CVE-2015-3148 because it did not reflect the fact that the HAVE_GSSAPI define was meanwhile substituted by USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE. This issue was introduced in RHEL 6.7 and affects RHEL 6 curl only."

      "Detail": "It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-3148 in curl was incomplete. An application using libcurl with HTTP Negotiate authentication could incorrectly re-use credentials for subsequent requests to the same server."
