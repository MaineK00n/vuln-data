  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "fs/overlayfs/copy_up.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2.6 uses an incorrect cleanup code path, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (dentry reference leak) via filesystem operations on a large file in a lower overlayfs layer."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of overlayfs. An attacker can leak file resources in the system by opening a large file with write permissions on a overlay filesystem that is insufficient to deal with the size of the write.\nWhen unmounting the underlying device, the system is unable to free an inode and this will consume resources.  Repeating this for all available inodes and memory will create a denial of service situation."
