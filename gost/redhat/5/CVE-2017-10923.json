  "Mitigation": "\nOn systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than\nguest administrator, running only kernels which only send sane IPIs\n(i.e. targeting valid CPUs) will prevent untrusted guest users from\nexploiting this issue.  However untrusted guest administrators can\nstill trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from\nloading code into the kernel (e.g by disabling loadable modules etc) or\nfrom using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel\nprivilege.\n    ",
