      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in various system emulators of QEMU that occurs while performing MMIO r/w operations when the respective handler function is not defined. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to invoke the MMIO operation to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service."
