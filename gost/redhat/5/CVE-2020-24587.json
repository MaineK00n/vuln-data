  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation. An attacker within the wireless range can abuse a logic flaw in the WiFi implementation by reassembling packets from multiple fragments under different keys, treating them as valid. This flaw allows an attacker to send a fragment under an incorrect key, treating them as a valid fragment under the new key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
