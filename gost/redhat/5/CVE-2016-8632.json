  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The tipc_msg_build function in net/tipc/msg.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 does not validate the relationship between the minimum fragment length and the maximum packet size, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the TIPC networking subsystem which could allow for memory corruption and possible privilege escalation.  The flaw involves a system with an unusually low MTU (60) on networking devices configured as bearers for the TIPC protocol. An attacker could create a packet which will overwrite memory outside of allocated space and allow for privilege escalation."
