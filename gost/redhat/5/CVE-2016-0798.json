  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Memory leak in the SRP_VBASE_get_by_user implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by providing an invalid username in a connection attempt, related to apps/s_server.c and crypto/srp/srp_vfy.c."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL performed SRP user database look-ups using the SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() function. A remote attacker connecting to certain SRP servers with an invalid user name could leak approximately 300 bytes of the server's memory per connection."
