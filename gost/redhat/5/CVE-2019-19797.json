      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in transfig in the way the `fig2dev` program handled the processing of Fig format files. Specifically, the flaw affects the translation process of Fig codes into the box graphics language. This flaw allows for potential exploitation by crashing the `fig2dev` program by tricking it into processing specially crafted Fig format files."
