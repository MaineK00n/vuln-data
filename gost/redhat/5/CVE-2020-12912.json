  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A potential vulnerability in the AMD extension to Linux \"hwmon\" service may allow an attacker to use the Linux-based Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface to show various side channel attacks. In line with industry partners, AMD has updated the RAPL interface to require privileged access."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of RAPL for AMD CPUs. This flaw allows a user with a local account to use the RAPL interface to gain information on the CPU execution state, resulting in an information leak of sensitive data across security boundaries. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
