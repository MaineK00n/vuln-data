      "Detail": "Apache Struts 2.0.0 to 2.5.20 forced double OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in tag attributes, may lead to remote code execution."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in Apache Struts frameworks. When forced, struts2 performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags attributes such as ID so it is possible to pass a value that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes will be rendered. With a carefully crafted request, this can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The largest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
