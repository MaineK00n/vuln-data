  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag esi:when when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression while it's being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member, there is no check to ensure that the stack won't overflow."

When handling the tag esi:when, when ESI is enabled, Squid calls the ESIExpression::Evaluate function which uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
