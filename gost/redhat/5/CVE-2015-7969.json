  "Mitigation": "\nThe leak is small. Preventing the creation of large numbers of new domains, and limiting the number of times an existing domain can be rebooted, can reduce the impact of this vulnerability. Switching from disaggregated to a non-disaggregated operation does NOT mitigate the XEN_DOMCTL_max_vcpus vulnerability. Rather, it simply recategorises the vulnerability to hostile management code, regarding it \"as designed\"; thus it merely reclassifies these issues as \"not a bug\". Users and vendors of disaggregated systems should not change their configuration.\n    ",
