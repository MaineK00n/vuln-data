Reason: This candidate is a duplicate of CVE-2014-5139, and has also been used to refer to an unrelated topic that is currently outside the scope of CVE.  This unrelated topic is a LibreSSL code change adding functionality for certain process-bifurcation use cases that might arise in future LibreSSL-based applications.  There is no CVE ID associated with this LibreSSL code change.  As of 20140730, CVE-2014-5139 is an undisclosed vulnerability in a different product, with ongoing vulnerability coordination that had previously used the CVE-2014-2970 ID."
