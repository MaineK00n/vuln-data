      "Detail": "The (1) mod_dav_svn and (2) svnserve servers in Subversion 1.6.0 through 1.7.19 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.11 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and abort) via crafted parameter combinations related to dynamically evaluated revision numbers."

      "Detail": "An assertion failure flaw was found in the way the SVN server processed certain requests with dynamically evaluated revision numbers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the SVN server (both svnserve and httpd with the mod_dav_svn module) to crash."
