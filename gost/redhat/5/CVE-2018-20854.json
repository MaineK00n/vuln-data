      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.20. drivers/phy/mscc/phy-ocelot-serdes.c has an off-by-one error with a resultant ctrl-\u003ephys out-of-bounds read."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of ocelot-serdes hardware. An incorrect limits calculation allowed an off-by-one calculation, which could read out of bounds data and panic the system. If the data was not out of bounds, the following code could then write data into the out of bounds area, corrupting memory or other possible consequences."
