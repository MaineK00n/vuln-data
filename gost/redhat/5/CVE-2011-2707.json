  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The ptrace_setxregs function in arch/xtensa/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 3.1 does not validate user-space pointers, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory locations via a crafted PTRACE_SETXTREGS request."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in ptrace_setxregs in arch/xtensa/kernel/ptrace.c on the Xtensa architecture, where there was an arbitrary kernel read problem seen without a pre-address validation. This flaw allows an attacker with local access and special user privileges (of CAP_SYS_PTRACE) to cause a confidentiality breach, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and system availability."
