  "Statement": "This issue affects the Linux kernel shipping with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Future updates for the respective releases may address the issue.\nThis issue does not not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 7, MRG-2 kernels.\nThis has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
