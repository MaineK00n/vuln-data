  "Cwe": "CWE-120-\u003eCWE-416",
  "Statement": "This flaw is rated as a having Moderate impact, because it can happen only during close of the service (or when handling ARES_ECONNREFUSED). The Red Hat Enterprise Linux not affected (all versions), because the version of c-ares being used is 1.13.0, and the bug introduced in 1.16.0 (and then fixed in 1.16.1).",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "If calling wait_ares(channel) before ares_destroy() in the service that uses c-ares, then this should prevent this bug.",

      "Detail": "A possible use-after-free and double-free in c-ares lib version 1.16.0 if ares_destroy() is called prior to ares_getaddrinfo() completing. This flaw possibly allows an attacker to crash the service that uses c-ares lib. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to this service availability."
