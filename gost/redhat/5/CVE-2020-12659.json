    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.7. xdp_umem_reg in net/xdp/xdp_umem.c has an out-of-bounds write (by a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) because of a lack of headroom validation."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Network XDP (the eXpress Data Path) module in the Linux kernel's xdp_umem_reg function in net/xdp/xdp_umem.c. When a user with special user privilege of CAP_NET_ADMIN (or root) calls setsockopt to register umem ring on XDP socket, passing the headroom value larger than the available space in the chunk, it leads to an out-of-bounds write, causing panic or possible memory corruption. This flaw may lead to privilege escalation if a local end-user is granted permission to influence the execution of code in this manner."
