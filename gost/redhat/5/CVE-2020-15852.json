  "Cwe": "CWE-270",
  "Statement": "The vulnerability can only be exploited in domains which have been granted access to IO ports by Xen. This is typically only the hardware domain, and PV guests configured with PCI passthrough. x86 HVM/PVH guests are not affected by this flaw.",

  "Name": "CVE-2020-15852",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.5 through 5.7.9, as used in Xen through 4.13.x for x86 PV guests. An attacker may be granted the I/O port permissions of an unrelated task. This occurs because tss_invalidate_io_bitmap mishandling causes a loss of synchronization between the I/O bitmaps of TSS and Xen, aka CID-cadfad870154."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, in the way IOPL and IOPERM system calls were handled during context switches in x86 PV guests. This flaw allows a local guest user to escalate their privileges to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
