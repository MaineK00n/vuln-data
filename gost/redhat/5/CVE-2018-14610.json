    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is out-of-bounds access in write_extent_buffer() when mounting and operating a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of verification that each block group has a corresponding chunk at mount time, within btrfs_read_block_groups in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c."

    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the btrfs filesystem code in the Linux kernel. An out-of-bounds access is possible in write_extent_buffer() when mounting and operating a crafted btrfs image due to a lack of verification at mount time within the btrfs_read_block_groups() in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c function. This could lead to a system crash and a denial of service."
