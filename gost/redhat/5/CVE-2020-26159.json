  "Cwe": "CWE-193-\u003eCWE-787",
  "Statement": "Red Hat Ceph Storage 4 is not affected because the affected method, concat_opt_exact_str is not shipped. However, there is an identical flaw in concat_opt_exact_info_str and concat_opt_exact_info, which do not exist in the most recent version of oniguruma as methods. The impact is rated as low because we ship an older version without this exact exploit, so an attacker could not simply copy and paste this exploit, but would need to dig into the code itself and modify this attack for the older version of the code.",

  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
