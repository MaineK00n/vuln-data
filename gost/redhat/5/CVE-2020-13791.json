    {
      "Detail": "hw/pci/pci.c in QEMU 4.2.0 allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access by providing an address near the end of the PCI configuration space."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the ati-vga emulator of the QEMU. The issue occurs while reading PCI configuration bytes via the ati_mm_read routine if the address sent by a guest is towards an end of the PCI configuration space. This flaw allows a guest user or process to crash the QEMU process resulting in a denial of service."
