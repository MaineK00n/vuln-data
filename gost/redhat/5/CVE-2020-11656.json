  "Statement": "As per the upstream bug at https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4722bdab08cb1 the flaw is in the error checking routine which is triggered only in debug builds. In release builds this is a no-op and therefore release builds are non-vulnerable. Red Hat packages are not vulnerable to this flaw (because we dont ship debug builds)",
