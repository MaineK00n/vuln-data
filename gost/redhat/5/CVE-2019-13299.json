      "Detail": "A heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in ImageMagick in the way it applies a value with arithmetic, relational, or logical operators to an image in GetPixelChannel. Applications compiled against ImageMagick libraries that accept untrustworthy images may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image to make the application crash or leak application data."
