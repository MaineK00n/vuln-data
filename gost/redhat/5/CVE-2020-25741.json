  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "fdctrl_write_data in hw/block/fdc.c in QEMU 5.0.0 has a NULL pointer dereference via a NULL block pointer for the current drive."

      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Floppy disk emulator of QEMU. This issue occurs while transferring data via the fdctrl_read_data() and fdctrl_write_data() routines if the current drive has a null block pointer. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service."
