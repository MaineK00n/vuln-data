  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "cURL and libcurl 7.10.6 through 7.41.0 does not properly re-use NTLM connections, which allows remote attackers to connect as other users via an unauthenticated request, a similar issue to CVE-2014-0015."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was discovered that libcurl could incorrectly reuse NTLM-authenticated connections for subsequent unauthenticated requests to the same host. If an application using libcurl established an NTLM-authenticated connection to a server, and sent subsequent unauthenticated requests to the same server, the unauthenticated requests could be sent over the NTLM-authenticated connection, appearing as if they were sent by the NTLM authenticated user."
