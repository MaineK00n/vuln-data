  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The _bfd_slurp_extended_name_table function in bfd/archive.c in GNU binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid write, segmentation fault, and crash) via a crafted extended name table in an archive."

      "Detail": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way certain binutils utilities processed archive files. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted archive file, it could cause the utility used to process that archive to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that utility."
