  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "http.cc in Squid 3.x before 3.5.15 and 4.x before 4.0.7 proceeds with the storage of certain data after a response-parsing failure, which allows remote HTTP servers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed response."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that squid did not properly handle errors when failing to parse an HTTP response, possibly leading to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP response."
