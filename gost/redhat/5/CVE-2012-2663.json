  "Statement": "This issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.\nThe risks in breaking compatability associated with fixing this flaw outweigh the benefits of the fix, therefore Red Hat does not plan to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.\nPlease note that the remote DoS issue in the way how Linux kernel treats SYN+FIN flags set is being handled under different CVE, CVE-2012-6638, and is planned to be fixed in all affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "Instead of --syn use --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK SYN in your rulesets in case you want to also match packets with both SYN+FIN flags set.",
