  "Statement": "This issue does not affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, as the code with the flaw is not present in this product.\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "This issue requires rogue PCI device to be planted on the system. Once such rogue PCI device is successfully planted however, attacker has usually more options for hostile takeover than just exploiting this issue. To mitigate this issue restrict physical access to your systems to only approved personnel (and generally follow general physical security guidelines) and do not use/insert into system PCI devices with unknown origin.",
