  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Integer overflow in tif_packbits.c in bmp2tif in libtiff 4.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted BMP image, related to dimensions, which triggers an out-of-bounds read."

      "Detail": "A flaw was discovered in the bmp2tiff utility. By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool."
