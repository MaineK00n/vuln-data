  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The (1) bundled GnuTLS SSL/TLS plugin and the (2) bundled OpenSSL SSL/TLS plugin in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.10 do not properly consider the Basic Constraints extension during verification of X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that Pidgin's SSL/TLS plug-ins had a flaw in the certificate validation functionality. An attacker could use this flaw to create a fake certificate, that Pidgin would trust, which could be used to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against Pidgin."
