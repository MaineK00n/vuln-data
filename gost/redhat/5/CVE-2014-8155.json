  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "GnuTLS before 2.9.10 does not verify the activation and expiration dates of CA certificates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a certificate issued by a CA certificate that is (1) not yet valid or (2) no longer valid."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that GnuTLS did not check activation and expiration dates of CA certificates. This could cause an application using GnuTLS to incorrectly accept a certificate as valid when its issuing CA is already expired."
