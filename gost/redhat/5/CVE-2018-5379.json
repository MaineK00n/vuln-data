    {
      "Detail": "The Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) prior to version 1.2.3 can double-free memory when processing certain forms of UPDATE message, containing cluster-list and/or unknown attributes. A successful attack could cause a denial of service or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code."

    {
      "Detail": "A double-free vulnerability was found in Quagga. A BGP peer could send a specially crafted UPDATE message which would cause allocated blocks of memory to be free()d more than once, potentially leading to a crash or other issues."
