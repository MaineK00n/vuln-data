  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Race condition in the rds_sendmsg function in net/rds/sendmsg.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by using a socket that was not properly bound.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-6937."

      "Detail": "A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel, where a race condition caused a NULL pointer dereference in the RDS socket-creation code. A local attacker could use this flaw to create a situation in which a NULL pointer crashed the kernel."
