    {
      "Detail": "A potential DoS flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd) implementation of the QEMU version \u003e= v5.0. Virtio-fs is meant to share a host file system directory with a guest via virtio-fs device. If the guest opens the maximum number of file descriptors under the shared directory, a denial of service may occur. This flaw allows a guest user/process to cause this denial of service on the host."
