  "Statement": "This issue does not affect the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they do not enable the pcnet backend driver.\nThis issue does not affect the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 based versions of the qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.\nThis issue affects the versions of the kvm and xen packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 based versions of qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3. Future updates for the respective releases may address this flaw.\nPlease note that AMD PCNet adapter has to be explicitly enabled per-guest as it is not enabled in default configuration and is not supported by Red Hat in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (for a list of supported devices please consult https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Virtualization_Administration_Guide/sect-whitelist-device-options.html).",

    {
      "Detail": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the PCNET controller in QEMU allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending a packet with TXSTATUS_STARTPACKET set and then a crafted packet with TXSTATUS_DEVICEOWNS set."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet emulation handled multi-TMD packets with a length above 4096 bytes. A privileged guest user in a guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU process."
