  "Cwe": "CWE-416",
  "Statement": "This flaw can be triggered by parsing untrusted XML files via applications compiled with libxml2 causing the application to crash. For web browsers or browser like applications, which parse untrusted web content, it may be possible to trigger this flaw without any user intervention and cause remote code execution with the permissions of the user running the browser. For other applications this flaw is difficult to trigger and even difficult to exploit in real life situations.",

  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "xpointer.c in libxml2 before 2.9.5 (as used in Apple iOS before 10, OS X before 10.12, tvOS before 10, and watchOS before 3, and other products) does not forbid namespace nodes in XPointer ranges, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and memory corruption) via a crafted XML document."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Xpointer implementation of libxml2. An attacker could use this flaw against an application parsing untrusted XML files and compiled with libxml2 to leak small amount of memory data."
