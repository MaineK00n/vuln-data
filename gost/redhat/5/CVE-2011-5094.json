    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.x, with certain settings of the SSL_ENABLE_RENEGOTIATION option, does not properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protocols, which might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connection, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1473.  NOTE: it can also be argued that it is the responsibility of server deployments, not a security library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a specific environment."
