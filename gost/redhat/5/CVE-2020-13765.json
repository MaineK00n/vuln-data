  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "rom_copy() in hw/core/loader.c in QEMU 4.0 and 4.1.0 does not validate the relationship between two addresses, which allows attackers to trigger an invalid memory copy operation."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bound write access flaw was found in the way QEMU loads ROM contents at boot time. This flaw occurs in the rom_copy() routine while loading the contents of a 32-bit -kernel image into memory. Running an untrusted -kernel image may load contents at arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process."
