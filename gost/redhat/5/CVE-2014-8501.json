  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The _bfd_XXi_swap_aouthdr_in function in bfd/peXXigen.c in GNU binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) and possibly have other unspecified impact via a crafted NumberOfRvaAndSizes field in the AOUT header in a PE executable."

    {
      "Detail": "A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way various binutils utilities processed certain files. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, it could cause the utility used to process that file to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that utility."
