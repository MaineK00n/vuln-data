  "Mitigation": "Attackers can use specially-crafted files to trigger this stack-buffer overflow in cairo. Applications compiled with cairo, which do not parse untrusted 2D image files are not vulnerable to this flaw. cairo package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 is compiled with gcc's Stack Smashing Protection, which may reduce the impact of this flaw to crash only.",
