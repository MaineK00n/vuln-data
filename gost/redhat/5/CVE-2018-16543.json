  "Statement": "CVE-2018-16543 requires the \"device subclassing\" feature to be present in ghostscript in order to exploit it and corrupt the interpreter's memory. This feature appeared in Ghostscript-9.18. Thus ghostscript 9.07, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and older are not affected : although the attacker has access to the gssetresolution and gsgetresolution operators, they can not use these to corrupt memory.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24, gssetresolution and gsgetresolution allow attackers to have an unspecified impact."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was discovered that the ghostscript gssetresolution and gsgetresolution procedures were available, although they have dangerous side effects. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document."
