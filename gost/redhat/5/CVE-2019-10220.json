    {
      "Detail": "Linux kernel CIFS implementation, version 4.9.0 is vulnerable to a relative paths injection in directory entry lists."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SMB client. Path separators are not checked by cifs.ko when parsing directory listings back. A bad server can return relative paths that will be returned as-is to userspace potentially leading to manipulating of files outside shared mount points. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
