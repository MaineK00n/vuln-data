  "Cwe": "CWE-212",
  "Statement": "This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 may address this issue.\nThis has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "Preventing loading of the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system; however, the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See the kcs “How do I blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically?“  (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module from autoloading. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly.\nThis mitigation may not be suitable if the graphical login functionality is required.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Insufficient control flow in certain data structures for some Intel(R) Processors with Intel(R) Processor Graphics may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access."

      "Detail": "An information disclosure flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The i915 graphics driver lacks control of flow for data structures which may allow a local, authenticated user to disclose information when using ioctl commands with an attached i915 device. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
