  "Name": "CVE-2015-5352",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The x11_open_helper function in channels.c in ssh in OpenSSH before 6.9, when ForwardX11Trusted mode is not used, lacks a check of the refusal deadline for X connections, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a connection outside of the permitted time window."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that the OpenSSH client did not properly enforce the ForwardX11Timeout setting. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested."
