  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The tpacket_rcv function in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13 mishandles vnet headers, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow, and disk and memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A buffer overflow was discovered in tpacket_rcv() function in the Linux kernel since v4.6-rc1 through v4.13. A number of socket-related syscalls can be made to set up a configuration when each packet received by a network interface can cause writing up to 10 bytes to a kernel memory outside of a kernel buffer. This can cause unspecified kernel data corruption effects, including damage of in-memory and on-disk XFS data."
