    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in datafile.c in Gnuplot 5.2.5. This issue allows an attacker to conduct a heap-based buffer overflow with an arbitrary amount of data in df_generate_ascii_array_entry. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must pass an overlong string as the right bound of the range argument that is passed to the plot function."
