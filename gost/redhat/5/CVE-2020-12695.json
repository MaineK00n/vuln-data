  "Cwe": "CWE-20-\u003e(CWE-400|CWE-918)",
  "Statement": "This flaw does not affect the wpa_supplicant package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and 8. wpa_supplicant's WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) External Registrar functionality, which uses UPnP to act as a registrar for a WiFi access point, and hostapd's WPS UPnP functionality, are disabled in the build configuration. Additionally, wpa_supplicant's P2P functionality does not support UPnP as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and 8.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "To mitigate this flaw, close off the UPnP UDP port (usually 1900) and UPnP service ports from the Internet using a firewall. It's important to note that UPnP service ports vary based on the device, so device documentation should be consulted. Do not expose UPnP servers to the Internet. Exploitation of this flaw relies on HTTP SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests, which can be blocked using a network security appliance, as another mitigation option.",
