  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and that perform speculative reads of system registers may allow unauthorized disclosure of system parameters to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis, aka Rogue System Register Read (RSRE), Variant 3a."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor handle speculative access of system registers inaccessible to unprivileged user. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code which allows speculative load of system registers and that such register value could be subsequently used in speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged system registers by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks."
