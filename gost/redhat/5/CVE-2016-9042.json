  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the NTP project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Matthew Van Gundy (Cisco) as the original reporter.",
  "Mitigation": "\nImplement BCP-38.\n\nConfigure enough servers/peers that an attacker cannot target all of your time sources.\n\nProperly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running.\n    ",

  "Name": "CVE-2016-9042",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the origin timestamp check functionality of ntpd 4.2.8p9. A specially crafted unauthenticated network packet can be used to reset the expected origin timestamp for target peers. Legitimate replies from targeted peers will fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2) causing the reply to be dropped and creating a denial of service condition."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A vulnerability was found in NTP, affecting the origin timestamp check function. An attacker able to spoof messages from all of the configured peers could send crafted packets to ntpd, causing later replies from those peers to be discarded, resulting in denial of service."
