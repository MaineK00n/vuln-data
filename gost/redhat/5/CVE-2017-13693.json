    {
      "Detail": "The acpi_ds_create_operands() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/dsutils.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the kernel's ACPI interpreter when it does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump. This allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism."
