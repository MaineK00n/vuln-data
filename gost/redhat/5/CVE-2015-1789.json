    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the X509_cmp_time() function of OpenSSL, which is used to test the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates. An attacker could possibly use a specially crafted SSL/TLS certificate or CRL (Certificate Revocation List), which when parsed by an application would cause that application to crash."
