    {
      "Detail": "lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego_mech.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.14 relies on an inappropriate context handle, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer read and process crash) via a crafted SPNEGO packet that is mishandled during a gss_inquire_context call."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A resource-access flaw was discovered in krb5; the SPNEGO mechanism operates under an incorrect assumption when dealing with its context handles. If an application calls gss_inquire_context() on a partially-established SPNEGO context, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could possibly exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted SPNEGO packet and crashing the system."
