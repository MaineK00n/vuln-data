  "Cwe": "CWE-305",
  "Statement": "This flaw does not affect the version of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux because there is no support for samba as Active Directory Domain Controller.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Simon Fonteneau as the original reporter.",
  "Mitigation": "If the check password script parameter is not specified, Samba runs the internal password quality checks. The internal check makes sure that a password contains characters from three of five different characters categories.",

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in Samba, all versions starting samba 4.5.0 before samba 4.9.15, samba 4.10.10, samba 4.11.2, in the way it handles a user password change or a new password for a samba user. The Samba Active Directory Domain Controller can be configured to use a custom script to check for password complexity. This configuration can fail to verify password complexity when non-ASCII characters are used in the password, which could lead to weak passwords being set for samba users, making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks."
