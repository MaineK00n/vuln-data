  "Cwe": "CWE-476",
  "Statement": "This issue is rated as having Low impact because of the preconditions needed to trigger the error/resource cleanup code path (system-wide out-of-memory condition, high privileges or physical access). The attacker would have to be able to induce system-wide out-of-memory condition which itself could be seen as a local denial of service. It could be argued that having such privileges has the same impact as the flaw itself.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
