  "Cwe": "CWE-228",
  "Statement": "A flaw was found in the JSON encoder in dovecot, which an attacker could use to crash the application via usage of invalid UTF-8 characters in the login name during authentication or by using invalid UTF-8 sequence in email when OX push notification driver is enabled. The versions of dovecot shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux did not ship the vulnerable code and therefore were not affected by this flaw.",
