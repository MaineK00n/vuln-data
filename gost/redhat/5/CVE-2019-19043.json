  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A memory leak in the i40e_setup_macvlans() function in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_main.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering i40e_setup_channel() failures, aka CID-27d461333459."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The i40e_setup_macvlans function mishandles resource cleanup. A local attacker, able to induce the error conditions, could use this flaw to crash the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
