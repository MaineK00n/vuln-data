  "Statement": "Red Hat no longer considers this bug to be a security issue. The change introduced in bash errata RHSA-2014:1306, RHSA-2014:1311 and RHSA-2014:1312 removed the exposure of the bash parser to untrusted input, mitigating this problem to a bug without security impact.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access, and untrusted-pointer read and write operations) via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169."
