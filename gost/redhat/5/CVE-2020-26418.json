  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Memory leak in Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.8 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was discovered in the Apache Kafka protocol dissector of Wireshark while decoding packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when processed, would potentially make Wireshark crash resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
