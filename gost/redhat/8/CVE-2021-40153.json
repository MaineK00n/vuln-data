  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "squashfs_opendir in unsquash-1.c in Squashfs-Tools 4.5 stores the filename in the directory entry; this is then used by unsquashfs to create the new file during the unsquash. The filename is not validated for traversal outside of the destination directory, and thus allows writing to locations outside of the destination."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in Squashfs-tools, where it is vulnerable to attacks similar to zip-slip. During extraction, a file can escape the destination directory either via the '../' string to access the parent directory or via symlinks. This flaw allows a specially crafted squashfs archive to install or overwrite files outside of the destination directory."
