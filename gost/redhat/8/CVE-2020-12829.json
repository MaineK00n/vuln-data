  "Statement": "This flaw did not affect the versions of `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, as they did not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a later version of the package.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8 and RHEL Advanced Virtualization are not affected by this flaw, as the SM501 device is not built and shipped with the products listed.",

    {
      "Detail": "In QEMU through 5.0.0, an integer overflow was found in the SM501 display driver implementation. This flaw occurs in the COPY_AREA macro while handling MMIO write operations through the sm501_2d_engine_write() callback. A local attacker could abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process in sm501_2d_operation() in hw/display/sm501.c on the host, resulting in a denial of service."
