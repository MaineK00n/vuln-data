    {
      "Detail": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the ARM SIGPAGE functionality of Linux Kernel v5.4.66 and v5.4.54. The latest version (5.11-rc4) seems to still be vulnerable. A userland application can read the contents of the sigpage, which can leak kernel memory contents. An attacker can read a process’s memory at a specific offset to trigger this vulnerability. This was fixed in kernel releases: 4.14.222 4.19.177 5.4.99 5.10.17 5.11"

      "Detail": "An information disclosure flaw exists in the ARM SIGPAGE functionality of the Linux kernel. An attacker with a local account can read the contents of the sigpage, which contains previously initialized kernel memory contents. This flaw requires an attacker to read a process’s memory at a specific offset to trigger this vulnerability."
