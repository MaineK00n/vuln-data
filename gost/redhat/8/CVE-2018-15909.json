      "Detail": "In Artifex Ghostscript 9.23 before 2018-08-24, a type confusion using the .shfill operator could be used by attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files to crash the interpreter or potentially execute code."

      "Detail": "It was discovered that the ghostscript .shfill operator did not properly validate certain types. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document."
