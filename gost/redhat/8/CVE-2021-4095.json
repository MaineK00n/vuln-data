  "Statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not affected by this issue as either KVM dirty ring logging is not supported (RHEL 6, RHEL 7) or KVM Xen hypercall interface is not enabled (RHEL 8).",

    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's KVM when dirty ring logging is enabled without an active vCPU context. An unprivileged local attacker on the host may use this flaw to cause a kernel oops condition and thus a denial of service by issuing a KVM_XEN_HVM_SET_ATTR ioctl."
