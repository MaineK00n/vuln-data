  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Intel for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "A temporary measure would be to remove the ability for non-root users \nto read the current RAPL energy reporting metrics.\nThis can be done with the command:\n$ sudo chmod 400 /sys/class/powercap/intel_rapl/*/energy_uj\nThis mitigation will only work on the current boot and will need to be reapplied at each system boot to remain in effect.",
