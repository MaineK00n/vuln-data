      "Detail": "A race condition flaw was found in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel in btrfs file-system. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special user privilege to cause a denial of service due to not locking an extent buffer before a cloning operation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
