  "Statement": "",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Qualys Research Labs for reporting this issue.",

  "Name": "CVE-2018-1125",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow in pgrep. This vulnerability is mitigated by FORTIFY, as it involves strncat() to a stack-allocated string. When pgrep is compiled with FORTIFY (as on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora), the impact is limited to a crash."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "If a process inspected by pgrep has an argument longer than INT_MAX bytes, \"int bytes\" could wrap around back to a large positive int (rather than approaching zero), leading to a stack buffer overflow via strncat()."
