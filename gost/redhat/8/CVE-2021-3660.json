  "Cwe": "CWE-1021",
  "Statement": "In cockpit versions 236 and above (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 and above), this flaw should not be exploitable, as the session cookie has the `SameSite=Strict;` option enabled, preventing the Web Browsers to reuse it from 3rd party web sites. This results in the cockpit website not being logged in when coming from an embedded 3rd party web site.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "An X-Frame-Options header can be added to responses to prevent these attacks.",
