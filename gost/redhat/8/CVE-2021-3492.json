  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Shiftfs, an out-of-tree stacking file system included in Ubuntu Linux kernels, did not properly handle faults occurring during copy_from_user() correctly. These could lead to either a double-free situation or memory not being freed at all. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion) or gain privileges via executing arbitrary code. AKA ZDI-CAN-13562."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw use after free (or use before allocation) in the Linux kernel Shiftfs file-system was found in the way user calls one of the few ioctls.\nThe highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
