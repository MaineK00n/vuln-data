  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is to skip loading the affected module mt76 onto the system until we have a fix available. This can be done by a blacklist mechanism and ensures the driver is not loaded at the boot time.\n~~~\nHow do I blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically?\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 \n~~~",

      "Detail": "A memory overflow and data corruption flaw were found in the Mediatek MT76 driver module for WiFi in mt76_add_fragment in drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/dma.c. An oversized packet with too many rx fragments causes an overflow and corruption in memory of adjacent pages. A local attacker with a special user or root privileges can cause a denial of service or a leak of internal kernel information."
