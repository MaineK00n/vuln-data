  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "hw/ide/pci.c in QEMU before 5.1.1 can trigger a NULL pointer dereference because it lacks a pointer check before an ide_cancel_dma_sync call."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the IDE disk emulator of QEMU. This issue occurs while canceling an I/O operation via the ide_cancel_dma_sync() routine if a block drive pointer is null. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service."
