  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a denial of service in ps via mmap buffer overflow. Inbuilt protection in ps maps a guard page at the end of the overflowed buffer, ensuring that the impact of this flaw is limited to a crash (temporary denial of service)."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "Due to incorrect accounting when decoding and escaping Unicode data in procfs, ps is vulnerable to overflowing an mmap()ed region when formatting the process list for display. Since ps maps a guard page at the end of the buffer, impact is limited to a crash."
