  "Cwe": "CWE-319",
  "Statement": "",
  "Acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Mark Gray (Red Hat) and Sabrina Dubroca (Red Hat).",
  "Mitigation": "A possible workaround for this flaw is to configure IPsec for all traffic between the endpoints, instead of specifically for the UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnels. If GENEVE tunnels are not used, this flaw will not be triggered. In that case, it is possible to disable those tunnels, by unloading the \"geneve\" kernel module and blacklisting it (See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for a\nguide on how to blacklist modules).",

Traffic between two Geneve endpoints may be unencrypted when IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel allowing anyone between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
