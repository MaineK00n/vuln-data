  "Statement": "",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "As the attacker must have the ability to write to these files, a possible mitigation would be to reduce the access that users and their processes would have to the files used in the attack.  The files within the /proc/ filesystem can be temporarily modified with the chmod/chown command for each boot.",
