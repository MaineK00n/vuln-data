  "Statement": "The following Red Hat products do ship the vulnerable component, but do not enable the unsafe conditions needed to exploit, lowering their vulnerability impact:\n* JBoss Data Grid 7\n* Business Process Management Suite 6\n* Business Rules Management Suite 6\n* JBoss Data Virtualization 6\n* Red Hat Fuse Service Works 6\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform\n* Red Hat OpenShift containers: ose-metering-hadoop, ose-metering-hive, ose-logging-elasticsearch5, ose-logging-elasticsearch6  \nThese products may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\nIn Red Hat Openshift 4 there are no plans to maintain the ose-logging-elasticsearch5 container, therefore it has been marked wontfix at this time and may be fixed in a future update. \nThe following Red Hat products ship OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind, but do not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it exploitable:\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13\nAs such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\nThe following Red Hat products are not affected by this flaw because they use a more recent version of jackson-databind that does not contain the vulnerable code:\n* CodeReady Studio 12.16.0\n* CodeReady WorkSpaces Server Container\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8\n* Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\n* Red Hat Satellite 6\n* Red Hat OpenShift container: ose-metering-presto",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "The following conditions are needed for an exploit, we recommend avoiding all if possible:\n* Deserialization from sources you do not control\n* `enableDefaultTyping()`\n* `@JsonTypeInfo using `id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS`\n* avoid javax.swing in the classpath",
