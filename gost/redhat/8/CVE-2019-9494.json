  "Statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 as they did not include support for SAE (Simultaneous\nAuthentication of Equals).\nThis issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they are not compiled with SAE (Simultaneous\nAuthentication of Equals) enabled. In particular, the CONFIG_SAE=y option is not set at compile time.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The implementations of SAE in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable to side channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side channel attack that can be used for full password recovery. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected."
