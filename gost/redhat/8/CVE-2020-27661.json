      "Detail": "A divide-by-zero flaw was found in QEMU in the dwc-hsotg (dwc2) USB host controller emulation. More specifically, HCCHAR_MPS was read from a device register and later used as a divisor without performing a sanity check. This flaw allows a malicious or buggy guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service."
