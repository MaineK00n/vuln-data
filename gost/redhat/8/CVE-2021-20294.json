  "Mitigation": "Stack canaries, non-executable stack (NX), address space layout randomization (ASLR) are binary hardening protections enabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 that should greatly limit the impact of this flaw. An additional mitigation is to not use readelf to read files from untrusted sources.\nTo learn more about binary hardening protections in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please see https://access.redhat.com/articles/65299",
