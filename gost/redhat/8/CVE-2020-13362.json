      "Detail": "An out-of bounds read-access flaw was found in the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 emulator of the QEMU. This flaw occurs in the' megasas_lookup_frame' routine when the 's-\u003ereply_queue_head' is set to a malicious value. A guest user or process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in a denial of service."
