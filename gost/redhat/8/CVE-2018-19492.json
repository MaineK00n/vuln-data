    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in cairo.trm in Gnuplot 5.2.5. This issue allows an attacker to conduct a buffer overflow with an arbitrary amount of data in the cairotrm_options function. This flaw is caused by a missing size check of an argument passed to the \"set font\" function. This issue occurs when the Gnuplot pngcairo terminal is used as a backend."
