  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in drivers/scsi/aacraid/commctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13. There is potential exposure of kernel stack memory because aac_send_raw_srb does not initialize the reply structure."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the aac_send_raw_srb and aac_get_hba_info in drivers/scsi/aacraid/commctrl.c in the SCSI, where an uninitialized variable could copy stack-allocated structs to userspace without initializing its member's variables. This flaw can lead to the exposure of kernel stack memory. Clearing the memory by memset to ZERO at initialization can prevent information leaks."
