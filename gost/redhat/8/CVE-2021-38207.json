      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A buffer overflow and lockup, leading to a denial of service, can occur when a remote attacker sends heavy network traffic for approximately ten minutes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
