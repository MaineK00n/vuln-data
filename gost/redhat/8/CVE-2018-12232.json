  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In net/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.1, there is a race condition between fchownat and close in cases where they target the same socket file descriptor, related to the sock_close and sockfs_setattr functions. fchownat does not increment the file descriptor reference count, which allows close to set the socket to NULL during fchownat's execution, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference issue was found in the Linux kernel. If the close() and fchownat() system calls share a socket file descriptor as an argument, then the two calls can race and trigger a NULL pointer dereference leading to a system crash and a denial of service."
