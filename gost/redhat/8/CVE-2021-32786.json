  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In versions prior to 2.4.9, `oidc_validate_redirect_url()` does not parse URLs the same way as most browsers do. As a result, this function can be bypassed and leads to an Open Redirect vulnerability in the logout functionality. This bug has been fixed in version 2.4.9 by replacing any backslash of the URL to redirect with slashes to address a particular breaking change between the different specifications (RFC2396 / RFC3986 and WHATWG). As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring `mod_auth_openidc` to only allow redirection whose destination matches a given regular expression."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in mod_auth_openidc where it does not sanitize redirection URLs properly. This issue could be used by an attacker to facilitate phishing attacks by tricking users into visiting a trusted web application URL that redirects to an external and potentially malicious server. The highest threat from this liability is to confidentiality and integrity."
