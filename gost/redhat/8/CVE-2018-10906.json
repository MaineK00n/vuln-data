  "Statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of fuse as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as they did not consider escaped characters when checking mount options.  This issue is present in fuse packages included with Red Hat Virtualization, however it is not exploitable under any supported configuration.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects."
