  "Statement": "",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank zodf0055980 (SQLab NCTU Taiwan) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "This flaw can be mitigated by not converting or encoding untrusted input data using openjpeg. For example, just reading a file with openjpeg does not trigger the flaw. Additionally, the fortify protection limits the degree of exploitation that the flaw could be used to achieve.",

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in openjpeg's src/lib/openjp2/t2.c in versions prior to 2.4.0. This flaw allows an attacker to provide crafted input to openjpeg during conversion and encoding, causing an out-of-bounds write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
