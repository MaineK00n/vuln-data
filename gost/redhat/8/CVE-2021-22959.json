  "Statement": "Red Hat Quay from version 3.4 consumes nodejs from RHEL, so security tracking is provided by the container health index on the customer portal [1]. Additionally there is no impact from this issue on Quay 3.3 and 3.2 because nodejs is only used at build time and is no longer shipped, starting with Quay 3.5 [2].\n[1] https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/quay/quay-rhel8/600e03aadd19c7786c43ae49?container-tabs=security\n[2] https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1409\nTherefore Quay component is marked as \"Will not fix\".",

      "Detail": "The parser in accepts requests with a space (SP) right after the header name before the colon. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) in llhttp \u003c v2.1.4 and \u003c v6.0.6."

    {
      "Detail": "An HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) vulnerability was found in the llhttp library, used by Node.JS. Spaces as part of the header names were accepted as valid. In situations where HTTP conversations are being proxied (such as proxy, reverse-proxy, load-balancer), an attacker can use this flaw to inject arbitrary messages through the proxy. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."
