  "Statement": "This flaw is rated as having a Moderate impact because in the default configuration, the issue can only be triggered by a privileged local user.\nFor the all versions of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 the fix already applied, so not affected.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the vulnerability not actual too, and it is known that XFRM subsystem vulnerabilities requires CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.\nIn order to exploit this issue the attacker needs CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, which needs to be granted especially by the administrator to the attacker's process. This in turn requires granting CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to the process' binary and/or attacker's account.\nAnother possibility to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for an attacker is running a process inside a user+network namespace with mapped root privileges inside the namespace. Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not have unprivileged user namespaces enabled by default, local or remote unprivileged users also cannot abuse namespaces to grant this capability to themselves and elevate their privileges.",

      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s XFRM subsystem when flushing the XFRM tunnel. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
