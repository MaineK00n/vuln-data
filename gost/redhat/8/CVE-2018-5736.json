  "Name": "CVE-2018-5736",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An error in zone database reference counting can lead to an assertion failure if a server which is running an affected version of BIND attempts several transfers of a slave zone in quick succession. This defect could be deliberately exercised by an attacker who is permitted to cause a vulnerable server to initiate zone transfers (for example: by sending valid NOTIFY messages), causing the named process to exit after failing the assertion test. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way zone databases were handled by bind. An attacker with permissions to initiate a zone transfer could cause bind to crash."
