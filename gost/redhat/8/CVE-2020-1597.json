      "Detail": "A flaw was found in ASP.NET Core. Client disconnects were not properly handled in all circumstances. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted requests that would consume more disk and CPU resources than necessary potentially leading to a denial of service via resource exhaustion. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
