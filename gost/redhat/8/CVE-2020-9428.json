      "Detail": "In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.1, 3.0.0 to 3.0.8, and 2.6.0 to 2.6.14, the EAP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-eap.c by using more careful sscanf parsing."

    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Wireshark in the EAP dissector. An attacker can trigger the flaw by injecting special packets onto the wire or by convincing a victim user into opening a malformed packet trace file."
