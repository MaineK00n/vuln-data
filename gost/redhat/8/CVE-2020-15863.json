  "Statement": "The XGMAC device can only be found on highbank and midway QEMU ARM emulated machines. This flaw did not affect the following versions of QEMU as they did not include support for XGMAC:\n* `qemu-kvm-ma` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n* `qemu-kvm-rhev` as shipped with Red Hat Virtualization and Red Hat OpenStack.\n* `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and 8.\n* `virt:8.2/qemu-kvm` as shipped with RHEL Advanced Virtualization.",

      "Detail": "hw/net/xgmac.c in the XGMAC Ethernet controller in QEMU before 07-20-2020 has a buffer overflow. This occurs during packet transmission and affects the highbank and midway emulated machines. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential privileged code execution. This was fixed in commit 5519724a13664b43e225ca05351c60b4468e4555."
