  "Statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) ships binary packages built from the cockpit source RPM, which was affected by this flaw and subsequently updated to address the issue.\nAll OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) versions to date ship with an image that contains a cockpit-kubernetes RPM, built separately from the same cockpit SRPM.  The cockpit-kubernetes RPM is not affected by this vulnerability as it does not contain the affected code, thus OCP is also marked \"not affected\".  Updates for all other cockpit RPMs should be applied from the appropriate RHEL channels.",
