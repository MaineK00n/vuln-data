  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "fs/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5 has a may_create_in_sticky use-after-free, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-d0cb50185ae9. One attack vector may be an open system call for a UNIX domain socket, if the socket is being moved to a new parent directory and its old parent directory is being removed."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The may_create_in_sticky in fs/namei.c function has a possible use-after-free which can allow a local user to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
