    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in Node.js 14.x, in versions before 14.11, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by delayed requests. When used as an edge server, this flaw allows an attacker to initiate a large number of HTTP requests, causing resource exhaustion and leaving the service unable to accept new connections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
