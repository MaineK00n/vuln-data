  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Beginning in v1.4.1 and prior to v1.4.9, due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-24031, the Zstandard command-line utility created output files with default permissions and restricted those permissions immediately afterwards. Output files could therefore momentarily be readable or writable to unintended parties."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in zstd. While the final file mode is reflective of the input file, when compressing or uncompressing, the file can temporarily gain greater permissions than the input and potentially leading to security issues (especially if large files are being handled)."
