    {
      "Detail": "In QEMU 1:4.1-1, 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u6, 1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u8, 1:3.1+dfsg-8~deb10u1, 1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u2, and 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u12 (fixed), when executing script in lsi_execute_script(), the LSI scsi adapter emulator advances 's-\u003edsp' index to read next opcode. This can lead to an infinite loop if the next opcode is empty. Move the existing loop exit after 10k iterations so that it covers no-op opcodes as well."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in QEMU's LSI53C895A device emulator. When executing LSI scripts, a crafted sequence of I/O requests may cause the emulator to enter into an infinite loop. This vulnerability could be executed locally and would affect the availability of the system."
