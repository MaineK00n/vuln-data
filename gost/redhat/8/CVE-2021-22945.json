    {
      "Detail": "When sending data to an MQTT server, libcurl \u003c= 7.73.0 and 7.78.0 could in some circumstances erroneously keep a pointer to an already freed memory area and both use that again in a subsequent call to send data and also free it *again*."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in libcurl. When sending data to an MQTT server could in some situations lead to libcurl using already freed memory and then try to free it again. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality as well as system availability."
