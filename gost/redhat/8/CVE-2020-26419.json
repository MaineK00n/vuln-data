  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Memory leak in the dissection engine in Wireshark 3.4.0 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A memory leak was discovered in Wireshark while decoding packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. Multiple packet dissectors are potentially affected by this issue. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when processed, would make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
