    {
      "Detail": "A vulnerability was found in node-tar before version 4.4.2 (excluding version 2.2.2). An Arbitrary File Overwrite issue exists when extracting a tarball containing a hardlink to a file that already exists on the system, in conjunction with a later plain file with the same name as the hardlink. This plain file content replaces the existing file content. A patch has been applied to node-tar v2.2.2)."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in nodejs-tar in versions prior to 4.4.2. An arbitrary file overwrite can occur when extracting tarballs containing a hard-link to a file that already exists in the system. Further, a file that matches the hard-link may overwrite the system's files with the contents of the extracted file. The highest threat from the vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
