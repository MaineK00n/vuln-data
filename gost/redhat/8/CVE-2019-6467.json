  "Cwe": "",
  "Statement": "The most common bind configuration which is affected by this flaw is, if the server, in addition to performing NXDOMAIN redirection for recursive clients, is also serving a local copy of the root zone or using mirroring to provide the root zone, although other configurations are also possible.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "Exploitation of this defect can be effectively prevented by disabling the nxdomain-redirect feature in the nameserver's configuration.",

  "Name": "CVE-2019-6467",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A programming error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can cause an assertion failure in query.c if the alternate namespace used by nxdomain-redirect is a descendant of a zone that is served locally. The most likely scenario where this might occur is if the server, in addition to performing NXDOMAIN redirection for recursive clients, is also serving a local copy of the root zone or using mirroring to provide the root zone, although other configurations are also possible. Versions affected: BIND 9.12.0-\u003e 9.12.4, 9.14.0. Also affects all releases in the 9.13 development branch."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way \"nxdomain-redirect\" feature was implemented in bind. An attacker could use this flaw on a server with a vulnerable configuration to cause bind to exit, denying service to other clients."
