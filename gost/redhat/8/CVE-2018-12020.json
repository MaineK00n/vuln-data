  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "mainproc.c in GnuPG before 2.2.8 mishandles the original filename during decryption and verification actions, which allows remote attackers to spoof the output that GnuPG sends on file descriptor 2 to other programs that use the \"--status-fd 2\" option. For example, the OpenPGP data might represent an original filename that contains line feed characters in conjunction with GOODSIG or VALIDSIG status codes."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A data validation flaw was found in the way gnupg processes file names during decryption and signature validation. An attacker may be able to inject messages into gnupg verbose message logging which may have the potential to bypass the integrity of signature authentication mechanisms and could have other unintended consequences if applications take action(s) based on parsed verbose gnupg output."
