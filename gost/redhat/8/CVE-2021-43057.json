      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.8. A use-after-free in selinux_ptrace_traceme (aka the SELinux handler for PTRACE_TRACEME) could be used by local attackers to cause memory corruption and escalate privileges, aka CID-a3727a8bac0a. This occurs because of an attempt to access the subjective credentials of another task."

In this flaw, an attempt to access the subjective credentials of another task may cause memory corruption by a user with local access and escalate privileges."
