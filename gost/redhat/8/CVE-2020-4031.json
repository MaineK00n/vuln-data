  "Cwe": "CWE-416",
  "Statement": "Although the vulnerable code could have been in versions of freerdp shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8, the build configuration disables the shadow-server functionality and thus the vulnerable code is not shipped. Therefore, versions of freerdp shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 are not affected. The version of freerdp shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 does not contain the vulnerable code in the first place.",
