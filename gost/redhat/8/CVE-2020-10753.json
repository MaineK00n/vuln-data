  "Statement": "* Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 3 and 4 are affected by this vulnerability. Note: although this issue affects the RadosGW S3 API, it does not affect the Swift API.\n* Red Hat Openshift Container Storage( RHOCS) 4.2 is affected by this flaw. However, because RHOCS 4.2 is now in the Maintenance Phase of support, this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) 13 is not affected by this flaw because RHOSP 13 only ships the ceph client libraries and does not build server code.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Adam Mohammed (Linode) for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges William Bowling as the original reporter.",
  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
