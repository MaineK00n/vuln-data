  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Encode.pm, as distributed in Perl through 5.34.0, allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse Encode::ConfigLocal library (in the current working directory) that preempts dynamic module loading. Exploitation requires an unusual configuration, and certain 2021 versions of Encode.pm (3.05 through 3.11). This issue occurs because the || operator evaluates @INC in a scalar context, and thus @INC has only an integer value."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in perl-Encode, where the Perl5 Encode module loaded modules within the current directory. This flaw allows an attacker with write access to the current directory of a Perl5 process to inject arbitrary Perl code when this module is loaded, which can be used for a local privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
