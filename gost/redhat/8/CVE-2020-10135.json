  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in Bluetooth BR/EDR Core Specification v5.2 and earlier may allow an unauthenticated user to complete authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could impersonate a Bluetooth BR/EDR master or slave to pair with a previously paired remote device to successfully complete the authentication procedure without knowing the link key."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooth protocol affecting the Bluetooth BR/EDR authentication. An attacker with physical access to the Bluetooth connection could perform a spoofing attack impersonating the address of a previously paired remote device. This attack may result in the attacking device completing the authentication procedure successfully despite not possessing the link key. This flaw, in turn, could permit an attacker to initiate the Bluetooth Key Negotiation (KNOB) attack more efficiently, potentially gaining full access as the remote paired device."
