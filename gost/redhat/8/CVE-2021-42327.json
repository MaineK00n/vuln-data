      "Detail": "dp_link_settings_write in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm_debugfs.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.14 allows a heap-based buffer overflow by an attacker who can write a string to the AMD GPU display drivers debug filesystem. There are no checks on size within parse_write_buffer_into_params when it uses the size of copy_from_user to copy a userspace buffer into a 40-byte heap buffer."

      "Detail": "A flaw heap buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's AMD Radeon graphics card driver was found in the way user writes some malicious data to the AMD GPU Display Driver Debug Filesystem (to the VGA sub-directory of the /sys/kernel/debug/ directory). A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system."
