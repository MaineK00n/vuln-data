  "Statement": "This issue affected Linux kernel versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux from 8.3 and prior the versions. RHEL 8.4 and later versions are not affected.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "As the FUSE module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled  by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install fuse /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-fuse.conf\nThe system will need to be restarted if the FUSE modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the CIFS kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while the FUSE filesystems are in  use.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",
