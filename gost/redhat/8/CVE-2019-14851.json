  "Acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Eric Blake (Red Hat).",
  "Mitigation": "If nbdkit is configured with TLS client authentication, only trusted clients can carry out this attack.\nOnly attackers that can connect to the nbdkit service can exploit this vulnerability. If nbdkit is not exposed over TCP (eg, nbdkit -U), or is bound only to a private network interface, or is protected by firewall rules, the attack surface is correspondingly limited.",
