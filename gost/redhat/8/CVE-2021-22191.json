  "Statement": "Versions of Wireshark shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 are not affected by this flaw.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "This flaw can be entirely mitigated by ensuring that Wireshark users do not click arbitrary links found in wire captures and from pcapng files. The exploitation of this flaw requires the user to click links found in the Wireshark UI.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Improper URL handling in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.3 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.11 could allow remote code execution via via packet injection or crafted capture file."

    {
      "Detail": "There's a flaw in Wireshark. An attacker who sends malicious links with schemes other than http/https over the wire or via a pcapng file, and who is able to get a victim user of Wireshark's user interface to click these links, could perform actions such as mounting volumes, or in some cases launching undesired programs."
