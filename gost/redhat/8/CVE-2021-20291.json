  "Statement": "The vulnerability was first exposed in v1.23.8 of containers/storage (and subsequently fixed in v1.28.1) with this git commit [1].\n* In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) only 4.7 contains a version of CRI-O (and openshift/ose-docker-builder) which uses a vulnerable version of containers/storage. Subsequently this has been addressed in OCP 4.7.7.\n* Red Hat Quay quay-builder-container is not affected because it uses a version of github.com/containers/storage earlier than v1.23.8\n* Red Hat Openshift Virtualization is not affected because all containers depending on github.com/containers/storage use a version earlier than v1.23.8\n* For Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because containers/storage is not directly used by the director-operator, no update will be provided at this time for the operator containers.\n[1] - https://github.com/containers/storage/blob/e9989a949a0d2c32fa82d3ff1076e33cfec58cb9/layers.go#L1332",
