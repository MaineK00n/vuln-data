  "Statement": "This flaw is rated as having a Low impact because the issue can only be triggered by an privileged local user (or user with physical access) as the issue only happens during unbinding the driver or removing the device.",
  "Acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Jeremy Cline (Red Hat).",
  "Mitigation": "To mitigate this issue, prevent the module nouveau from being loaded. Please see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for information on how to blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically.",
