  "Statement": "npm versions 8.0.0 and older provide a vulnerable version of the json-schema library. However, it is currently believed that in the context of npm, it is not possible to take advantage of the vulnerability.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 and Software Collections provide a vulnerable version of the json-schema library only as embedded in the npm package. As a result, the severity of the incident has been lowered for these 2 products.\nRed Hat Quay includes json-schema as a development dependency of quay-registry-container. As a result, the impact rating has been lowered to Moderate.\nIn Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP), Red Hat distributed tracing and Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth. This restricts access to the vulnerable json-schema library to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is reduced to Moderate.",
