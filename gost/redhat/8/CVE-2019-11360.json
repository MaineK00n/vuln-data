  "Statement": "This flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low because it requires unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw, as the shipped versions of `iptables` already include the patch. Although Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are affected, successful exploitation is prevented by Stack Smashing Protection (SSP), reducing the impact to a denial of service.\nNote that this flaw is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is in the Extended Life Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in iptables-restore. This flaw allows a local attacker with sufficiently high privileges, such as root, to provide a specially crafted file, causing a program crash or potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
