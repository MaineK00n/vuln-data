  "Cwe": "CWE-787",
  "Statement": "This issue is considered as having Low impact because it needs physical access to trigger and it's also in Technology Preview functionality. For more information regarding BTRFS support in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 refer to https://access.redhat.com/solutions/197643 .",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "As the BTRFS module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled  by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install btrfs /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-btrfs.conf\nThe system will need to be restarted if the BTRFS modules are loaded, it may be possible to unload them. In most circumstances, the BTRFS kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any BTRFS filesystems are mounted or in use.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",

      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image can lead to slab-out-of-bounds write access in index_rbio_pages in fs/btrfs/raid56.c."
