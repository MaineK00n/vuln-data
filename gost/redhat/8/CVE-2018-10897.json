  "Statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization includes reposync as a component from the base Enterprise Linux system. It is not used by virtualization or management components, and it is not generally useful to mirror untrusted repositories to either Hypervisor or Management Appliance. For Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, this issue affects only unlikely configurations and thus is rated as Moderate.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A directory traversal issue was found in reposync, a part of yum-utils, where reposync fails to sanitize paths in remote repository configuration files. If an attacker controls a repository, they may be able to copy files outside of the destination directory on the targeted system via path traversal. If reposync is running with heightened privileges on a targeted system, this flaw could potentially result in system compromise via the overwriting of critical system files. Version 1.1.31 and older are believed to be affected."
