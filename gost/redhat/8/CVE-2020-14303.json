  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-400",
  "Statement": "This flaw does not affect the version of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 because there is no support for samba as Active Directory Domain Controller.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Martin von Wittich (IServ GmbH) and Wilko Meyer (IServ GmbH) as the original reporters.",
  "Mitigation": "The NetBIOS over TCP/IP name resolution protocol is implemented as a UDP datagram on port 137.\nThe AD DC client and server-side processing code for NBT name resolution will enter a tight loop if a UDP packet with 0 data length is received.  The client for this case is only found in the AD DC side of the codebase, not that used by the the member server or file server.",
