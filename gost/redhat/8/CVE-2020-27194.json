  "Cwe": "CWE-190",
  "Statement": "This flaw is rated as having a Moderate impact because in the default configuration, the issue can only be triggered by a privileged local user.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Berkeley Packet Filter is available only for privileged users. However, if enabled for an unprivileged user, the mitigation is to disable unprivileged access to the BPF using the following sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.8.15. scalar32_min_max_or in kernel/bpf/verifier.c mishandles bounds tracking during use of 64-bit values, aka CID-5b9fbeb75b6a."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of the eBPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) code verifier, where an incorrect register bounds calculation occurs while in use of 64-bit values with scalar32_min_max_or (that is BPF_OR). This flaw allows an unprivileged local user (until param kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled is set) to have arbitrary read/write access to the kernel memory or escalate their privileges on the system."
