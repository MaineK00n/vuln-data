  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24, attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files to the builtin PDF14 converter could use a use-after-free in copydevice handling to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact."

    {
      "Detail": "It was discovered that the ghostscript PDF14 compositor did not properly handle the copying of a device. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document."
