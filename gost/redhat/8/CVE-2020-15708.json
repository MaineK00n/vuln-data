  "Cwe": "CWE-732",
  "Statement": "This is an Ubuntu specific flaw. The versions of `libvirt` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and RHEL Advanced Virtualization are not affected by this issue, as they leverage `polkit` for authentication. More specifically, the socket permission is 0666, and when an unprivileged user connects, `polkit` will validate the client and require them to provide the root password before `libvirt` allows any RPC calls to be performed.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Ubuntu's packaging of libvirt in 20.04 LTS created a control socket with world read and write permissions. An attacker could use this to overwrite arbitrary files or execute arbitrary code."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in libvirt, where an incorrect permissions issue occurs on the UNIX domain socket. This flaw allows a local attacker to access libvirt and escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability."
