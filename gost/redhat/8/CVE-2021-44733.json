  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11. This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory object."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw in the Linux kernel TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) subsystem was found in the way user calls ioctl TEE_IOC_OPEN_SESSION or TEE_IOC_INVOKE. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. If the Linux system non configured with the CONFIG_PREEMPT option or CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN option enabled, then it is unlikely that a user can trigger this issue."
