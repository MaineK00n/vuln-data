  "Mitigation": "As the snd module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled  by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install snd /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-snd.conf \nThe system will need to be restarted if the snd modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the snd kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while they are is in use.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10. There is a use-after-free in the sound subsystem because card disconnection causes certain data structures to be deleted too early. This is related to sound/core/init.c and sound/core/info.c."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s core sound driver code. A use-after-free in a race condition between disconnection events could allow a local attacker who can trigger disconnection events (remove or add hardware) to crash the system, corrupt memory, or escalate privileges."
