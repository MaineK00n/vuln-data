  "Statement": "This flaw has received a Severity of Low because in order for the flaw to be triggered, a victim user must run an arbitrary input file (most likely provided by a malicious user) in Vim script mode using `-s {scriptin}`, in order to be triggered. Users running arbitrary Vim scripts are opening themselves up to a whole heap of security risks already and this is NEVER recommended. Doing so with a privileged account is even more risky and not recommended either.\nThis flaw does not reproduce on versions of Vim shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or 8. Therefore, it has been marked as notaffected.",
