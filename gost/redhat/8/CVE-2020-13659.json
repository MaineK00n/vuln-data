    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 emulator of the QEMU. This issue occurs because the address_space_map() API while mapping physical memory into the host's virtual address space, may return NULL without setting the length parameter to zero (0). This flaw allows a guest user or process to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in a denial of service."
