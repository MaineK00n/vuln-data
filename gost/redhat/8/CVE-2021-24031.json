  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In the Zstandard command-line utility prior to v1.4.1, output files were created with default permissions. Correct file permissions (matching the input) would only be set at completion time. Output files could therefore be readable or writable to unintended parties."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in zstd. While the final file mode is reflective of the input file, when compressing or uncompressing, the file can temporarily gain greater permissions than the input and potentially leading to security issues (especially if large files are being handled)."
