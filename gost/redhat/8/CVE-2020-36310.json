    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A nested page fault is created when an address does not have a memslot associated to it. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. This flaw can be triggered using a malformed Virtual Machine. When triggered this bug will lead to the user-space component of KVM to freeze."
