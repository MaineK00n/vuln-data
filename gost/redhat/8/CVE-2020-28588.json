  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the /proc/pid/syscall functionality of Linux Kernel 5.1 Stable and 5.4.66. More specifically, this issue has been introduced in v5.1-rc4 (commit 631b7abacd02b88f4b0795c08b54ad4fc3e7c7c0) and is still present in v5.10-rc4, so itâ€™s likely that all versions in between are affected. An attacker can read /proc/pid/syscall to trigger this vulnerability, which leads to the kernel leaking memory contents."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw read uninitialized values in the Linux kernel syscall implementation on 32 bit-systems was found in the way user reading /proc/self/syscall.\nA local user could use this flaw to read three 64 bits uninitialized values, but cannot control which values. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
