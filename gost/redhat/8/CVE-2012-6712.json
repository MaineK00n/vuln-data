  "Statement": "The patch committed by upstream will prevent the misuse of the invalid station id, however it does not prevent the incorrect state being entered.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6,7 and 8 are not affected by this flaw.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 does not have the \"fix\" applied and may be vulnerable to this flaw.  Red Hat does not have plans to fix EL5 at this stage in its lifecycle.\nThis flaw only applies to systems running and using the intel iwlwifi driver.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel before 3.4, a buffer overflow occurs in drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-agn-sta.c, which will cause at least memory corruption."

      "Detail": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Intel wireless driver (drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-agn-sta.c) where the driver could be forced to connect to an invalid station. An attacker could use this flaw to corrupt memory or create a situation allowing for privilege escalation."
