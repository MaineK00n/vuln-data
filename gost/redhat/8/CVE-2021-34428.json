  "Statement": "In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the hive/presto/hadoop components that comprise the OCP metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of jetty. Since the release of OCP 4.6, the metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix. This may be fixed in the future.\nOCP 3.11 is out of the support scope for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities because is already in the Maintenance Support phase, hence the affected OCP 3.11 component has been marked as wontifx.\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated",

On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts this can result in a session not being invalidated. This can result in an application used on a shared computer being left logged in."

On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts, this could result in a session not being invalidated and a shared-computer application being left logged in. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."
