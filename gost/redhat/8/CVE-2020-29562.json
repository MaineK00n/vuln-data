  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.30 to 2.32, when converting UCS4 text containing an irreversible character, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a denial of service."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way glibc's iconv function handled UCS4 text containing an irreversible character. This flaw causes an application compiled with glibc and using the vulnerable function to terminate with an assertion, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
