    {
      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.0-rc7 (as distributed in ubuntu/linux.git on kernel.ubuntu.com), mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image and performing some operations can lead to slab-out-of-bounds read access in ttm_put_pages in drivers/gpu/drm/ttm/ttm_page_alloc.c. This is related to the vmwgfx or ttm module."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in ttm_put_pages in drivers/gpu/drm/ttm/ttm_page_alloc.c in the Linux kernelâ€™s graphics module. Incrementing the page pointer for huge pages was not in sync with the reference counter, and this could lead to an out-of-bounds access or a denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user privileges (or root) to cause memory exploitation."
