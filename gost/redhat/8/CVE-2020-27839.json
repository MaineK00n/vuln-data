  "Statement": "* Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 is not affected as it does not use authentication for the dashboard.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployments use the ceph package directly from the Ceph channel; the RHOSP package will not be updated at this time.\n* Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (RHOCS) 4 shipped ceph package for the usage of RHOCS 4.2 only which has reached End of Life. The shipped version of ceph package is neither used nor supported with the release of RHOCS 4.3.\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 does not include the ceph dashboard component.",
