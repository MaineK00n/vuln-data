  "Statement": "The versions of OpenCV as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 are affected by this flaw. Although it's technically possible that classifiers are loaded from untrusted sources, this is probably an unlikely case in practice.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 3.4.7 and 4.x before 4.1.1. There is an out of bounds read/write in the function HaarEvaluator::OptFeature::calc in modules/objdetect/src/cascadedetect.hpp, which leads to denial of service."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in OpenCV in the way the Cascade Classifier algorithm loaded and processed the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers. This flaw allows a remote attacker to provide a specially crafted classifier in the form of an XML file that, when loaded by an application linked to OpenCV, would crash the application, causing a denial of service."
