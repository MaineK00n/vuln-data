  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** snd_ctl_elem_add in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.3 has a count=info-\u003eowner line, which later affects a private_size*count multiplication for unspecified \"interesting side effects.\" NOTE: kernel engineers dispute this finding, because it could be relevant only if new callers were added that were unfamiliar with the misuse of the info-\u003eowner field to represent data unrelated to the \"owner\" concept. The existing callers, SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD and SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE, have been designed to misuse the info-\u003eowner field in a safe way."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture subsystem's snd_ctl_elem_add mishandles the private_size*count multiplication when the addition of audio control elements happen leading to a denial of service."
