  "Statement": "This issue does not affect the default OpenSSH sshd configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6 and 7.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "This issue can be mitigated by disabling keyboard-interactive authentication method.  That can be achieved by setting \"ChallengeResponseAuthentication no\" in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config configuration file and restarting the sshd service.",

  "Name": "CVE-2015-5600",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam element on this list."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was discovered that the OpenSSH sshd daemon did not check the list of keyboard-interactive authentication methods for duplicates. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the MaxAuthTries limit, making it easier to perform password guessing attacks."
