  "Statement": "Red Hat does not consider crash of client application, using regcomp() \nor regexec() routines on untrusted input without preliminary checking \nthe input for the sanity, to be a security issue (the described deficiency \nimplies and is a known limitation of the glibc regular expression engine \nimplementation). The expressions can be modified to avoid quantification \nnesting, or program modified to limit size of input passed to regular \nexpression engine. We do not currently plan to fix these flaws. If more \ninformation becomes available at a future date, we may revisit these issues.",

      "Detail": "The regcomp implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.11.3, and 2.12.x through 2.12.2, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a regular expression containing adjacent bounded repetitions that bypass the intended RE_DUP_MAX limitation, as demonstrated by a {10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,} sequence in the proftpd.gnu.c exploit for ProFTPD, related to a \"RE_DUP_MAX overflow.\""
