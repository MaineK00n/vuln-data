  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression) in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data structures."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that the boundary checks in the code implementing support for pre-authentication compression could have been optimized out by certain compilers. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could possibly use this flaw for further attacks against the privileged monitor process."
