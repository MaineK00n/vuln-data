This issue does not affect any version of the OpenSSL package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6 and 7, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1 and 2, and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3 because they did not include support for alternative certificate chains.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The X509_verify_cert function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1n, 1.0.1o, 1.0.2b, and 1.0.2c does not properly process X.509 Basic Constraints cA values during identification of alternative certificate chains, which allows remote attackers to spoof a Certification Authority role and trigger unintended certificate verifications via a valid leaf certificate."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL verified alternative certificate chains. An attacker able to supply a certificate chain to an SSL/TLS or DTLS client or an SSL/TLS or DTLS server using client authentication could use this flaw to bypass certain checks in the verification process, possibly allowing them to use one of the certificates in the supplied certificate chain as a CA certificate to generate an invalid certificate."
