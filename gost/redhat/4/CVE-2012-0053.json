  "Statement": "This issue affects httpd packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, which are now in the Extended Life Phase of their life cycle. Therefore this issue is not planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "As noted in the original reporter's advisory (see comment #5), this issue can be mitigated by using a custom ErrorDocument setting, such as:\nErrorDocument 400 \"Bad Request\"\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#errordocument\nIt should be noted that ErrorDocument setting using path or external URL does not mitigate this issue.\nIt should also be noted that this is not an issue by itself.  This can only be exploited via some other cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw found in a web application running on the server and may allow injected JavaScript to gain access to HttpOnly cookies, if the application uses this protection for its cookies.",
