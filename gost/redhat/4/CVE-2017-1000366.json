  "Name": "CVE-2017-1000366",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted LD_LIBRARY_PATH values to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to alias, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. Please note that additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not directly exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. This affects glibc 2.25 and earlier."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way memory was being allocated on the stack for user space binaries. If heap (or different memory region) and stack memory regions were adjacent to each other, an attacker could use this flaw to jump over the stack guard gap, cause controlled memory corruption on process stack or the adjacent memory region, and thus increase their privileges on the system. This is glibc-side mitigation which blocks processing of LD_LIBRARY_PATH for programs running in secure-execution mode and reduces the number of allocations performed by the processing of LD_AUDIT, LD_PRELOAD, and LD_HWCAP_MASK, making successful exploitation of this issue more difficult."
