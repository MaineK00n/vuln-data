  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "CRLF injection vulnerability in libcurl 6.0 through 7.x before 7.40.0, when using an HTTP proxy, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via CRLF sequences in a URL."

      "Detail": "It was discovered that the libcurl library failed to properly handle URLs with embedded end-of-line characters. An attacker able to make an application using libcurl access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP proxy could use this flaw to inject additional headers to the request or construct additional requests."
