  "Statement": "This flaw affects various versions of Java as shipped with Red Hat products. A patch is available for Java 7 and Java 8, but not for previous versions of Java shipped with Red Hat products. Although no patch is available for previous versions of Java as shipped with Red Hat products, the impact of this flaw has been addressed in several components that utilize Java HashMap in such a way that may expose a denial of service flaw.",
