  "Statement": "Red Hat does not consider this to a security issue.  In order for the crash condition to be observed, the RADIUS server must already be unresponsive for extended periods of time, the net result of which is that you cannot DoS an already-unresponsive server.  Other specialized conditions are required as well, that make an attack using this flaw unviable.",

      "Detail": "The wait_for_child_to_die function in main/event.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.x before 2.1.10, in certain circumstances involving long-term database outages, does not properly handle long queue times for requests, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by sending many requests."
