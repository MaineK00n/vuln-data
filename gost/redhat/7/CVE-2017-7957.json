  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "XStream through 1.4.9, when a certain denyTypes workaround is not used, mishandles attempts to create an instance of the primitive type 'void' during unmarshalling, leading to a remote application crash, as demonstrated by an xstream.fromXML(\"\u003cvoid/\u003e\") call."

    {
      "Detail": "It was found that XStream contains a vulnerability that allows a maliciously crafted file to be parsed successfully which could cause an application crash. The crash occurs if the file that is being fed into XStream input stream contains an instances of the primitive type 'void'. An attacker could use this flaw to create a denial of service on the target system."
