      "Detail": "The Linux kernel, before version 4.14.3, is vulnerable to a denial of service in drivers/md/dm.c:dm_get_from_kobject() which can be caused by local users leveraging a race condition with __dm_destroy() during creation and removal of DM devices. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) can directly perform the ioctl operations for dm device creation and removal and this would typically be outside the direct control of the unprivileged attacker."
