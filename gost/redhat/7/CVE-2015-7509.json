  "Statement": "This problem did not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and MRG-2. This issue is not planned to be corrected in future updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nThis issue is rated low as exploiting it requires physical (to plug in specially prepared usb disk) or root (to mount specially prepared filesystem) access to the system. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.",

      "Detail": "fs/ext4/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 3.7 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted no-journal filesystem, a related issue to CVE-2013-2015."
