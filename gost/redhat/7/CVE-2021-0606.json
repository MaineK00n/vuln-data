This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-168034487"
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The function drm_syncobj_handle_to_fd first calls drm_syncobj_find which increments the refcount of the object on success. In all of the drm_syncobj_handle_to_fd error paths, the refcount is decremented, but in the success path the refcount should remain at +1 as the struct drm_syncobj now belongs to the newly opened file. Instead, the refcount was incremented again to +2."
