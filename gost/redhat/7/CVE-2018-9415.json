    {
      "Detail": "In driver_override_store and driver_override_show of bus.c, there is a possible double free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID: A-69129004 References: Upstream kernel."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A race condition existed in the ARM Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver that could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
