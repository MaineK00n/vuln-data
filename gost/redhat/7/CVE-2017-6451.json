  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The mx4200_send function in the legacy MX4200 refclock in NTP before 4.2.8p10 and 4.3.x before 4.3.94 does not properly handle the return value of the snprintf function, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, which trigger an out-of-bounds memory write."

    {
      "Detail": "A vulnerability was found in NTP, in the legacy MX4200 refclock implementation. If this refclock was compiled in and used, an attacker may be able to induce stack overflow, leading to a crash or potential code execution."
