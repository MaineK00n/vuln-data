    {
      "Detail": "GEGL before 0.4.34, as used (for example) in GIMP before 2.10.30, allows shell expansion when a pathname in a constructed command line is not escaped or filtered. This is caused by use of the system library function for execution of the ImageMagick convert fallback in magick-load."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "Due to the use of the system command in the Magick-Load op used by gegl an attacker is able to craft a command line path that is able to lead to the execution of arbitrary shell commands that impacts availability, confidentiality and integrity."
