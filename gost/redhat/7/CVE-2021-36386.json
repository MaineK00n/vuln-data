  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "report_vbuild in report.c in Fetchmail before 6.4.20 sometimes omits initialization of the vsnprintf va_list argument, which might allow mail servers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via long error messages. NOTE: it is unclear whether use of Fetchmail on any realistic platform results in an impact beyond an inconvenience to the client user."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in fetchmail. The flaw lies in how fetchmail when running in verbose mode using the -v flag tries to log long messages that are created from long headers. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service attack or crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data availability. This flaw was earlier identified by CVE-2008-2711 and fixed, however it recently got reintroduced due to a code refactoring issue. The current bug fix applies a different approach than the earlier one."
