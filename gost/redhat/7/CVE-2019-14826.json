  "Cwe": "CWE-613",
  "Statement": "In order to exploit this flaw, an attacker would need to obtain a user's session cookie after the user has logged out but before the server-side credential cache expires. Typically, this will not be possible because browsers protect the cookie while it is valid and delete it immediately as instructed by the server on logout. In order to be exposed to this vulnerability, one would need to be accessing FreeIPA in a non-standard fashion with an insecure web browser or a client application that stores and shares excessive debugging information. Most users of FreeIPA will not be at risk from this flaw.",
