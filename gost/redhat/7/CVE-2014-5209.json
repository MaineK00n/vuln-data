  "Statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 in their default configurations. Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses the `restrict noquery` option by default, which denies ntpdc queries. No proper fix is available for this issue upstream, apart from disabling these kind of queries by default or denying them through the `restrict` access control command specified in /etc/ntp.conf. Users are adviced to use `noquery` in their configurations and allow them only from a trusted set of network addresses.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "If not already present, add `noquery` option to the `restrict` access control command specified in /etc/ntp.conf. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is shipped by default with the following setting:\nrestrict default nomodify notrap nopeer noquery",
