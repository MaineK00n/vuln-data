  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The XFS implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.15 improperly uses an old size value during remote attribute replacement, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (transaction overrun and data corruption) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging XFS filesystem access."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's XFS file system handled replacing of remote attributes under certain conditions. A local user with access to XFS file system mount could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system."
