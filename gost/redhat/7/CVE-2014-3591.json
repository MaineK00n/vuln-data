  "Mitigation": "In order to successfully exploit this flaw the attacker needs to following conditions:\n1. They need to be very close to the system, in order to record the fluctuations in the electromagnetic waves being emitted by the system.\n2. The attacker needs to send specially-crafted cipher text to the system for decryption.\n3. The attacker needs to record the electromagnetic fluctuations when these cipher texts are being decrypted.\nThe above conditions can be true only when a laptop is being used for decryption in an unsafe external environment. Typical server setups may not be vulnerable.",

      "Detail": "Libgcrypt before 1.6.3 and GnuPG before 1.4.19 does not implement ciphertext blinding for Elgamal decryption, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain the server's private key by determining factors using crafted ciphertext and the fluctuations in the electromagnetic field during multiplication."
