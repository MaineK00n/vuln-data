    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in mgetty before 1.2.1. In fax/faxq-helper.c, the function do_activate() does not properly sanitize shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. It is possible to use the ||, \u0026\u0026, or \u003e characters within a file created by the \"faxq-helper activate \u003cjobid\u003e\" command."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A command injection flaw was discovered in mgetty in the faxrunq script used to send queued faxes. The shell script faxrunq does not properly escape the arguments passed to faxsend before evaluating the command allowing a user, who has permissions to queue faxes in the system, to execute arbitrary command with elevated privileges."
