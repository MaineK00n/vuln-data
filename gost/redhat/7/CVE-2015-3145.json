  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was discovered that libcurl did not properly process cookies with a specially crafted \"path\" element. If an application using libcurl connected to a malicious HTTP server sending specially crafted \"Set-Cookies\" headers, this could lead to an out-of-bounds read, and possibly cause that application to crash."
