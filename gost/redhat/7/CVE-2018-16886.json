  "Statement": "OpenShift Container Platform 3.x, and 4.1 versions do not use etcd Role-based access control so they are not affected.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Matt Wheeler (Osirium) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "Ensure that the client server TLS certificate (specified in --cert-file argument or ETCD_CERT_FILE environment variable) does not include a CN (Common Name) field. If a Common Name field is part of this certificate, replace it with one which omits it.\nTo check the CN field of a certificate:\nopenssl x509 -noout -subject -in /path/to/client.crt | grep -o 'CN.*'\nTo check if there is a username matching the CN field in the TLS client certificate:\netcdctl user get \u003cTLS client certificate CN\u003e\nFor more information on TLS authentication features including how client-cert-auth is enabled, refer to the etcd transport security model documentation: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md\nFor more information on Role-based access control including how it is enabled, refer to the etcd role-based access control documentation: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/authentication.md",

      "Detail": "etcd versions 3.2.x before 3.2.26 and 3.3.x before 3.3.11 are vulnerable to an improper authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used and client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server TLS certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway."
