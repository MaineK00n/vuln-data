  "Statement": "This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, as KASLR feature is not present or enabled in these products.\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, its real-time kernel, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9 LE. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

    {
      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel through 4.15.4, the floppy driver reveals the addresses of kernel functions and global variables using printk calls within the function show_floppy in drivers/block/floppy.c. An attacker can read this information from dmesg and use the addresses to find the locations of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR."
