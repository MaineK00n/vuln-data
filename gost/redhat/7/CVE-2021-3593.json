  "Cwe": "CWE-824",
  "Statement": "This flaw does not affect the versions of SLiRP embedded in `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, because support for udp6 was introduced in a later version of the package. A future update may address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and RHEL Advanced Virtualization.\nIt is worth noting that although `qemu-kvm` is built with SLiRP networking support, due to its limitations, it is not used by the virtual machine guests by default.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the udp6_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr' structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects libslirp versions prior to 4.6.0."
