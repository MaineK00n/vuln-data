  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-200",
  "Statement": "* This flaw has had the severity level set to Moderate due to the attack complexity required to exhaust file descriptors at the time ForkExec is called, plus an attacker does not necessarily have direct control over where/how data is leaked.\n* Because Service Telemetry Framework1.2 will be retiring soon and the flaw's impact is lower, no update will be provided at this time for STF1.2's smart-gateway-container and sg-core-container.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "This bug can be mitigated by raising the per-process file descriptor limit.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Go before 1.16.12 and 1.17.x before 1.17.5 on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion."

      "Detail": "There's a flaw in golang's syscall.ForkExec() interface. An attacker who manages to first cause a file descriptor exhaustion for the process, then cause syscall.ForkExec() to be called repeatedly, could compromise data integrity and/or confidentiality in a somewhat uncontrolled way in programs linked with and using syscall.ForkExec()."
