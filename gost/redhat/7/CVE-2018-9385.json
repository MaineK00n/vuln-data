    {
      "Detail": "In driver_override_store of bus.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID: A-74128061 References: Upstream kernel."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that the Linux kernel is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds buffer write due to incorrect bounds check in driver_override_store() function in drivers/amba/bus.c. This can lead to a memory corruption, a system panic, and to a denial of service. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
