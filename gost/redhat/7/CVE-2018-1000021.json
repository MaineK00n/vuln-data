    {
      "Detail": "GIT version 2.15.1 and earlier contains a Input Validation Error vulnerability in Client that can result in problems including messing up terminal configuration to RCE. This attack appear to be exploitable via The user must interact with a malicious git server, (or have their traffic modified in a MITM attack)."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that the Git client printed server-sent ANSI escape codes to the terminal without any sanitization, leading to execution of arbitrary escape sequences in the terminal emulator. Exploitation of this flaw by a MitM attacker could potentially result in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks under highly specific circumstances dependent on the usage of a vulnerable terminal emulator by the user."
