  "Statement": "This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 as the flaw is present in glusterfs-server, which is not shipped there.\nThis flaw affects glusterfs versions included in Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor. However, in recommended configurations, the vulnerability is only exposed to hypervisor administrators and can not be exploited from virtual machines or other hosts on the network. For Red Hat Virtualization, Product Security has rated this flaw as Moderate. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "To limit exposure of gluster server nodes :  \n1. gluster server should be on LAN and not reachable from public networks.  \n2. Use gluster auth.allow and auth.reject.  \n3. Use TLS certificates to authenticate gluster clients.\ncaveat: This does not protect from attacks by authenticated gluster clients.",
