  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the stv06xx subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.6.1. drivers/media/usb/gspca/stv06xx/stv06xx.c and drivers/media/usb/gspca/stv06xx/stv06xx_pb0100.c mishandle invalid descriptors, as demonstrated by a NULL pointer dereference, aka CID-485b06aadb93."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way the stv06xx driver in the Linux kernel handled certain types of USB descriptors. This flaw allows an attacker with the ability to induce the error conditions to crash the system."
