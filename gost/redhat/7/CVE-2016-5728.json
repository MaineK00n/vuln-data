    {
      "Detail": "Race condition in the vop_ioctl function in drivers/misc/mic/vop/vop_vringh.c in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux kernel before 4.6.1 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) by changing a certain header, aka a \"double fetch\" vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "Race condition vulnerability was found in drivers/misc/mic/vop/vop_vringh.c in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux kernel before 4.6.1. MIC VOP driver does two successive reads from user space to read a variable length data structure. Local user can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or can cause DoS by corrupting kernel memory if the data structure changes between the two reads."
