  "Statement": "The PostgreSQL Project does not consider this to be a vulnerability. By design, database super users have full rights to the context that PostgreSQL executes within, including reading \u0026 writing all files and code execution. See External References for more details.\nRed Hat Product Security concurs with upstream's assessment that this is not a vulnerability. Customers are advised to follow best practice when configuring PostgreSQL, which includes allocating only the minimum privileges to users. Super user privileges in particular must be very carefully controlled.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** In PostgreSQL 9.3 through 11.2, the \"COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM\" function allows superusers and users in the 'pg_execute_server_program' group to execute arbitrary code in the context of the database's operating system user. This functionality is enabled by default and can be abused to run arbitrary operating system commands on Windows, Linux, and macOS. NOTE: Third parties claim/state this is not an issue because PostgreSQL functionality for ‘COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM’ is acting as intended. References state that in PostgreSQL, a superuser can execute commands as the server user without using the ‘COPY FROM PROGRAM’."
