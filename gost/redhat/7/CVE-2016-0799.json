  "Statement": "The original issue fixed by OpenSSL upstream contains two distinct fixes. The first one is a format string flaw in the internal fmtstr functions, which may result in a OOB read flaw when printing very large string. This issue was assigned CVE-2016-0799\nThe second issue relates to the internal doapr_outch function of OpenSSL. It can result in an OOB write, or cause memory leaks. This issue has been assigned CVE-2016-2842 by MITRE as is now tracked as https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-2842",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter.",

      "Detail": "The fmtstr function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g improperly calculates string lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (overflow and out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large amount of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-2842."
