    {
      "Detail": "The BN_GF2m_mod_inv function in crypto/bn/bn_gf2m.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0e, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b does not properly handle ECParameters structures in which the curve is over a malformed binary polynomial field, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a session that uses an Elliptic Curve algorithm, as demonstrated by an attack against a server that supports client authentication."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was reported that OpenSSL could enter an infinite loop when processing an ECParameters structure if the curve specified is over a specially malformed binary polynomial field. This can be used to perform denial of service attacks against any system which processes public keys, certificate requests or certificates, including TLS clients and TLS servers with client authentication enabled."
