  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The ssl3_get_cert_verify function in s3_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k accepts client authentication with a Diffie-Hellman (DH) certificate without requiring a CertificateVerify message, which allows remote attackers to obtain access without knowledge of a private key via crafted TLS Handshake Protocol traffic to a server that recognizes a Certification Authority with DH support."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that an OpenSSL server would, under certain conditions, accept Diffie-Hellman client certificates without the use of a private key. An attacker could use a user's client certificate to authenticate as that user, without needing the private key."
