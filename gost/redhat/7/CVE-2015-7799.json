  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The slhc_init function in drivers/net/slip/slhc.c in the Linux kernel through 4.2.3 does not ensure that certain slot numbers are valid, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted PPPIOCSMAXCID ioctl call."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel where issuing certain ioctl() -s commands to the \"/dev/ppp\" device file could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A privileged user could use this flaw to cause a kernel crash and denial of service."
