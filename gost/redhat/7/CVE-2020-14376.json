  "Cwe": "CWE-120",
  "Statement": "This flaw does not affect the versions of `dpdk` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 or the versions embedded in Red Hat Virtualization or the Fast Datapath `openvswitch` package, as they do not enable generic crypto device library support. This causes the vulnerable code in vhost_crypto.c to not be included.\nThis flaw does not affect Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4 as dpdk (embedded in ceph source rpm) is not built in the packages, therefore the vulnerable code is not available in the resulting RPM and the issue cannot be exploited.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Ryan Hall for reporting this issue.",

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A lack of bounds checking when copying iv_data from the VM guest memory into host memory can lead to a large buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
