    {
      "Detail": "iproute2 before 5.1.0 has a use-after-free in get_netnsid_from_name in ip/ipnetns.c. NOTE: security relevance may be limited to certain uses of setuid that, although not a default, are sometimes a configuration option offered to end users. Even when setuid is used, other factors (such as C library configuration) may block exploitability."

    {
      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in iproute in the network namespace management component of the ip command-line utility. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the program while displaying network namespaces. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
