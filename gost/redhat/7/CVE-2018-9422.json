    {
      "Detail": "In get_futex_key of futex.c, there is a use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID: A-74250718 References: Upstream kernel."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "Non-optimized code for key handling of shared futexes was found in the Linux kernel in the form of unbounded contention time due to the page lock for real-time users. Before the fix, the page lock was an unnecessarily heavy lock for the futex path that protected too much. After the fix, the page lock is only required in a specific corner case."
