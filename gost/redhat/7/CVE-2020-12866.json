  "Cwe": "CWE-119-\u003eCWE-400",
  "Statement": "The vulnerable code is a part of \"driver for Epson ESC/I-2 scanners\" which was first introduced in sane-backends-1.0.25. (via https://gitlab.com/sane-project/backends/-/commit/d72f4663c0ad6e6f779c15c8baf5f92b675ae19a)  Therefore only versions of sane-backends shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is affected by this flaw.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "This flaw can be mitigated by limiting network scanner discovery to a trusted subnet via the \"net\" configuration in the \"/etc/sane.d/epsonds.conf\" configuration file. Also automatic network scanner discovery can be turned off by commenting out the line \"net autodiscovery\" in the same configuration file.",
