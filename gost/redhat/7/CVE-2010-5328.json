  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "include/linux/init_task.h in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35 does not prevent signals with a process group ID of zero from reaching the swapper process, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging access to this process group."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A process that is in the same process group as the ''init'' process (group id zero) can crash the Linux kernel with several system calls by passing in a process ID or process group ID of zero; a special value that indicates the current process ID or process group."
