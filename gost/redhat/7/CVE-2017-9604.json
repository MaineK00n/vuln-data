  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "KDE kmail before 5.5.2 and messagelib before 5.5.2, as distributed in KDE Applications before 17.04.2, do not ensure that a plugin's sign/encrypt action occurs during use of the Send Later feature, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that KMail's Send Later with Delay function bypassed OpenPGP signing and encryption, causing the message to be sent unsigned and in plain-text. A remote attacker, with access to the user's network traffic, could potentially use this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the plain-text email messages."
