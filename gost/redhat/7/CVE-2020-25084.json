      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the USB(xHCI/eHCI) controller emulators of QEMU. This flaw occurs while setting up the USB packet as a usb_packet_map() routine and returns an error that was not checked. This flaw allows a guest user or process to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service."
