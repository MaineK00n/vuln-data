  "Statement": "",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the GNU Nettle project for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "As per upstream: For applications that want to support older versions of nettle, the bug can be worked around by adding a check that the RSA ciphertext is in the range 0 \u003c ciphertext \u003c n, before attempting to decrypt it.",
