  "Statement": "This is essentially an integer truncation issue, and not an integer overflow. We have determined that this should not affect any other data allocated close to the  16-bit integer in question \"dbentry-\u003e n_key_data\".

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is a variable \"dbentry-\u003en_key_data\" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a \"u4\" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data."
