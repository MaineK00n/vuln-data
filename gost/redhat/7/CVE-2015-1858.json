  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Multiple buffer overflows in gui/image/qbmphandler.cpp in the QtBase module in Qt before 4.8.7 and 5.x before 5.4.2 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted BMP image."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A memory corruption flaw was found in the way Qt handled certain Bitmap (BMP) files. If a user loaded a specially crafted BMP image file with an application linked against Qt, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application."
