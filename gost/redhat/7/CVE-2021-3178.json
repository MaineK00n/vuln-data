  "Cwe": "CWE-22",
  "Statement": "This flaw is rated as having Moderate impact because of the attack limitation: the user can gain more access than expected only inside NFS root mount point if already have permissions for the access to this NFS sub-folder.\nAlso this is a known limitation of NFSv3 and there is a known and documented configuration option to avoid this. As such, this is more of an hardening rather than security issue.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "When export subdirectory of a filesystem, enable subtree_check option of the NFS server for preventing possibility of accessing outside of this export.",

    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.8, when there is an NFS export of a subdirectory of a filesystem, allows remote attackers to traverse to other parts of the filesystem via READDIRPLUS. NOTE: some parties argue that such a subdirectory export is not intended to prevent this attack; see also the exports(5) no_subtree_check default behavior."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw leak of the file handle for parent directory in the Linux kernel's NFS3 functionality was found in the way user calls READDIRPLUS. A local user could use this flaw to traverse to other parts of the file-system than mounted sub-folder."
