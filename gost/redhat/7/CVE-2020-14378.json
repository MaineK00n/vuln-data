  "Cwe": "CWE-190-\u003eCWE-400",
  "Statement": "This flaw does not affect the versions of `dpdk` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 or the versions embedded in Red Hat Virtualization or the Fast Datapath `openvswitch` package, as they do not enable generic crypto device library support. This causes the vulnerable code in vhost_crypto.c to not be included.\nThis flaw does not affect Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4 as dpdk (embedded in ceph source rpm) is not built in the packages, therefore the vulnerable code is not available in the resulting RPM and the issue cannot be exploited.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Ryan Hall for reporting this issue.",

  "Name": "CVE-2020-14378",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An integer underflow in dpdk versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5 in the `move_desc` function can lead to large amounts of CPU cycles being eaten up in a long running loop. An attacker could cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending on how `vhost_crypto` is being used this could prevent other VMs or network tasks from being serviced by the busy DPDK lcore for an extended period."
