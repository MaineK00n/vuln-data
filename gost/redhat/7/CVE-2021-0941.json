  "Statement": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.\nA kernel update will be required to mitigate the flaw for the root or users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.",

      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in net/core/filter.c in __bpf_skb_max_len in the Linux kernel. A missing sanity check to the current MTU check may allow a local attacker with special user privilege to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information."
