  "Statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as there is no service that performs asynchronous polkit requests in a vulnerable way.\nThe version of systemd delivered in OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 and included in CoreOS images has been superseded by the version delivered in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. CoreOS updates for systemd in will be consumed from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 channels.",
