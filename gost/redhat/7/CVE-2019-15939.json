    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in OpenCV 4.1.0. There is a divide-by-zero error in cv::HOGDescriptor::getDescriptorSize in modules/objdetect/src/hog.cpp."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A divide by zero vulnerability was found in OpenCV in the way HOGDescriptor objects are created by loading their properties from a local file. Local files with no \"cellSize\" property may be vulnerable to this flaw. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted file that, when loaded by a victim, would cause a floating-point exception leading to a denial of service."
