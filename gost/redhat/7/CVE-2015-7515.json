  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The aiptek_probe function in drivers/input/tablet/aiptek.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted USB device that lacks endpoints."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's aiptek USB tablet driver (aiptek_probe() function in drivers/input/tablet/aiptek.c). The driver assumed that the interface always had at least one endpoint. By using a specially crafted USB device with no endpoints on one of its interfaces, an unprivileged user with physical access to the system could trigger a kernel NULL pointer dereference, causing the system to panic."
