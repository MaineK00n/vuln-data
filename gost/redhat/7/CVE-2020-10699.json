  "Statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 7, 8.0 and 8.1 are not vulnerable to this flaw, because they do not ship a version of targetcli that contains the targetclid.socket socket.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux version 8.2 is affected by this flaw.\nThis issue did not affect the version of targetcli shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3, as the package did not include the support for systemd which provides targetclid.socket socket.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "- Do not enable targetclid, this would prevent the socket to be created\n- Manually change the socket's permission every time it is being created :\n$ sudo chmod 0600 /var/run/targetclid.sock",
