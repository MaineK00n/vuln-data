  "Statement": "",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Weichen.Chen (Alibaba) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "To exploit this flaw, the attacker must have configured the  set audit-failure to AUDIT_FAIL_PANIC(2). Configuring this to not panic on failure while restarting the daemon will result in the server surviving audit event failure during heavy audit events even when the daemon is restarting.",
