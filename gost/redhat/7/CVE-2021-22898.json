  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the Curl Project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Harry Sintonen as the original reporter.",
  "Mitigation": "This issue can be avoided by not setting any telnet options for the curl command line tool (using the -t / --telnet-option command line option) or the libcurl library (using the CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS option) when telnet protocol is not meant to be used.\nIf telnet protocol needs to be used with curl / libcurl, along with the NEW_ENV telnet option, ensure that no environment variable set via the NEW_ENV option has the name or value longer than 127 bytes.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way curl handled telnet protocol option for sending environment variables, which could lead to sending of uninitialized data from a stack-based buffer to the server. This issue leads to potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol."
