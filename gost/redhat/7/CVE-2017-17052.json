      "Detail": "The mm_init function in kernel/fork.c in the Linux kernel before 4.12.10 does not clear the -\u003eexe_file member of a new process's mm_struct, allowing a local attacker to achieve a use-after-free condition and to induce a kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash or possibly have unspecified other impact by running a specially crafted program. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we feel it is unlikely."
