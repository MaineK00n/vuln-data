  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The sanity_check_raw_super function in fs/f2fs/super.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.1 does not validate the segment count, which allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that the sanity_check_raw_super() function in 'fs/f2fs/super.c' file in the Linux kernel before version 4.12-rc1 does not validate the f2fs filesystem segment count.  This allows an unprivileged local user to cause a system panic and DoS. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
