  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "sd_wp_addr in hw/sd/sd.c in QEMU 4.2.0 uses an unvalidated address, which leads to an out-of-bounds read during sdhci_write() operations. A guest OS user can crash the QEMU process."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds read-access flaw was found in the SD Memory Card emulator of the QEMU. This flaw occurs while performing block write commands via sdhci_write(), if a guest user has sent an 'address' which is out-of-bounds of 's-\u003ewp_groups'. A guest user or process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in a denial of service."
