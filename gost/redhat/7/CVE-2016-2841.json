    {
      "Detail": "The ne2000_receive function in the NE2000 NIC emulation support (hw/net/ne2000.c) in QEMU before 2.5.1 allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and QEMU process crash) via crafted values for the PSTART and PSTOP registers, involving ring buffer control."

    {
      "Detail": "An infinite-loop flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built with NE2000 NIC emulation support. The flaw could occur when receiving packets over the network. A privileged user inside a guest could exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU instance (denial of service)."
