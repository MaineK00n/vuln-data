  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-787",
  "Statement": "This issue is rated as having Moderate impact because of being limited to only IPV6 port 1720 being used and if with particular module (nf_conntrack_h323) for Voice Over IP H.323.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin (Virtuozzo) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "A mitigation to this flaw would be to no longer use IPV6 on affected hardware until the kernel has been updated or to disable Voice Over IP H.323 module. Existing systems that have h323-conntrack-nat kernel module loaded will need to unload the \"nf_conntrack_h323\" kernel module and blacklist it ( See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for a guide on how to blacklist modules).",

This flaw allows an unauthenticated remote user to crash the system, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
