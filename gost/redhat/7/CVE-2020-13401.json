  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in Docker Engine before 19.03.11. An attacker in a container, with the CAP_NET_RAW capability, can craft IPv6 router advertisements, and consequently spoof external IPv6 hosts, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in Docker when it creates network bridges that accept IPv6 router advertisements by default. This flaw allows an attacker who can execute code in a container to possibly spoof rogue IPv6 router advertisements to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against the host network or another container."
