  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-400",
  "Statement": "This flaw is rated as having Low impact, because it is a denial of service only and requires the ZRAM kernel module to be loaded, which it is not the default, and oading kernel modules is a privileged operation.",
  "Acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Luca Bruno (Red Hat).",
  "Mitigation": "Changing permissions on the files within /sys will prevent regular users from being able to trigger this issue, however permissions changed within /sys do not persist between reboots and will need to be reapplied after each boot.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernel module, where a user with a local account and the ability to read the /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file can create ZRAM device nodes in the /dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel memory and is not accounted for a user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device. With this vulnerability, continually reading the device may consume a large amount of system memory and cause the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer to activate and terminate random userspace processes, possibly making the system inoperable."
