  "Mitigation": "As the snd_usb_audio module will be auto-loaded when a usb device is hot plugged, the module can be prevented by loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install snd_usb_audio /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-snd-usb-audio.conf \nThe system will need to be restarted if the modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the sound kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any programs are active and the device are in use.\"\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "check_input_term in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9 mishandles recursion, leading to kernel stack exhaustion."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the sound mixer handling of the Linux kernel. An attacker with physical access able to insert a specially crafted USB device can cause a recursive loop which continues to consume the reserved stack space leading to a system panic. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
