  "Statement": "Although this issue affects versions of pip shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Software Collections and Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, Red Hat Product Security does not consider this to be a security vulnerability because per the pip documentation, this is intended behavior of pip when using the --extra-index-url flag. Therefore, this issue has been marked WONTFIX.",

  "Mitigation": "To protect from any unintended behavior,  use --index-url and do not use --extra-index-url OR explicitly set --index-url and use --extra-index-url.",

    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE: it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user is responsible for using --extra-index-url securely."
