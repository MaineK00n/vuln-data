  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The WRMSR processing functionality in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 does not properly handle the writing of a non-canonical address to a model-specific register, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) by leveraging guest OS privileges, related to the wrmsr_interception function in arch/x86/kvm/svm.c and the handle_wrmsr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that KVM's Write to Model Specific Register (WRMSR) instruction emulation would write non-canonical values passed in by the guest to certain MSRs in the host's context. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host."
