  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Integer overflow in the gs_heap_alloc_bytes function in base/gsmalloc.c in Ghostscript 9.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted Postscript (ps) file, as demonstrated by using the ps2pdf command, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write."

    {
      "Detail": "An integer overflow flaw was discovered in one of Ghostscript's memory allocation routines. A remote attacker could possibly exploit this flaw to cause a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file."
