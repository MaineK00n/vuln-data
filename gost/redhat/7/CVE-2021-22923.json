  "Name": "CVE-2021-22923",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "When curl is instructed to get content using the metalink feature, and a user name and password are used to download the metalink XML file, those same credentials are then subsequently passed on to each of the servers from which curl will download or try to download the contents from. Often contrary to the user's expectations and intentions and without telling the user it happened."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in curl in the way curl handles credentials when downloading content using the Metalink feature. This flaw allows malicious actors controlling a hosting server to gain access to credentials provided while downloading content without the user's knowledge. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
