  "Cwe": "CWE-20",
  "Statement": "* Although this flaw has a higher CVSS score because in a strict sense, the flaw could possibly enable code exec, either Red Hat products don't use WASM, or don't expose WASM functions in a way that make code exec possible. For this reason, the Red Hat impact for this flaw is Moderate.\n* Because the flawed code is not actually used in Service Telemetry Framework1.3, no update will be provided at this time for STF's sg-core-container.",

    {
      "Detail": "Go before 1.16.9 and 1.17.x before 1.17.2 has a Buffer Overflow via large arguments in a function invocation from a WASM module, when GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js is used."

      "Detail": "A validation flaw was found in golang. When invoking functions from WASM modules built using GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js, passing very large arguments can cause portions of the module to be overwritten with data from the arguments. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity."
