  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The Linux kernel before 4.5 allows local users to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by leveraging incorrect tracking of descriptor ownership and sending each descriptor over a UNIX socket before closing it. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-4312."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A resource-exhaustion vulnerability was found in the kernel, where an unprivileged process could allocate and accumulate far more file descriptors than the process' limit. A local, unauthenticated user could exploit this flaw by sending file descriptors over a Unix socket and then closing them to keep the process' fd count low, thereby creating kernel-memory or file-descriptors exhaustion (denial of service)."
