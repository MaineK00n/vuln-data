  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The ahci_commit_buf function in ide/ahci.c in QEMU allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference) when the command header 'ad-\u003ecur_cmd' is null."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QEMU emulator's IDE AHCI emulator. Exploitation of the flaw could occur while committing DMA buffer in ahci_commit_buf() if the command header 'ad-\u003ecur_cmd' was null. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance resulting in DoS. Reduced performance of the system is the highest threat to the system."
