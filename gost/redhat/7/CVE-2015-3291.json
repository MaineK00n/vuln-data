  "Statement": "This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not backport the nested NMI handler functionality.\nThis issue does affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform does not properly determine when nested NMI processing is occurring, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (skipped NMI) by modifying the rsp register, issuing a syscall instruction, and triggering an NMI."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that if a Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) occurred immediately after a SYSCALL call or before a SYSRET call with the user RSP pointing to the NMI IST stack, the kernel could skip that NMI."
