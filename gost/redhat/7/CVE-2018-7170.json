    {
      "Detail": "ntpd in ntp 4.2.x before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows authenticated users that know the private symmetric key to create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify a victim's clock via a Sybil attack. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1549."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in ntpd making it vulnerable to Sybil attacks. An authenticated attacker could target systems configured to use a trusted key in certain configurations and to create an arbitrary number of associations and subsequently modify a victim's clock."
