  "Statement": "For the attack to be successful, a new session must be created by pam_systemd. This is done only if the calling process is not already part of a session. Red Hat Enterprise Linux, in its default PAM configurations, does not let a session sneak in without systemd knowing about it, since pam_systemd is always called in every PAM config file. Unless a wrong PAM config file is in place, this vulnerability cannot be triggered on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8.",
