      "Detail": "A memory leak in the cx23888_ir_probe() function in drivers/media/pci/cx23885/cx23888-ir.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering kfifo_alloc() failures, aka CID-a7b2df76b42b."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The CX23888 Integrated Consumer Infrared Controller probe code handles resource cleanup low memory conditions. A local attacker able to induce low memory conditions could use this flaw to crash the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
