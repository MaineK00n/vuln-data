      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in drivers/iio/dac/ad5755.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.6. There is an out of bounds write in the function ad5755_parse_dt."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds flaw was found in the Industrial I/O Subsystem of the Linux kernel. A comparison for devnr limits is exceeded by one, where the current implementation allowed 0 to AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS, while the actual limit should have been till 'AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS - 1'.  This could lead to an out of bounds write to pdata-\u003edac[devnr]. The highest risk from this vulnerability is system availability."
