  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The tty_open function in drivers/tty/tty_io.c in the Linux kernel before 3.1.1 mishandles a driver-lookup failure, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted access to a device file under the /dev/pts directory."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's virtual console implementation handled reference counting when accessing pseudo-terminal device files (/dev/pts/*). A local, unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to crash the system."
