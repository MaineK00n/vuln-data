  "Mitigation": "While this is a network protocol being affected, the protocol is not available by default.  A local process (or user) can trigger the protocol to be used which will then be loaded automatically would then have the vulnerable code loaded and the attack vector opened.  To reiterate it is unlikely that most Linux systems will be using this protocol and therefore affected.\nMost systems do _NOT_ have this protocol used by services.   This is an infrequently used module and if you wish to blacklist it, you can follow the steps outlined in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 to blacklist the \"rds_tcp\" module for the relevant version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.",

      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.4.x before 4.4.195. There is a NULL pointer dereference in rds_tcp_kill_sock() in net/rds/tcp.c that will cause denial of service, aka CID-91573ae4aed0."
