    },
    {
      "Detail": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Bochs display driver of QEMU handled the PCIe extended configuration space when the device is connected to a PCIe bus. Accessing the PCIe extended config space could overflow the conventional PCI config space buffer due to limited memory allocation. As the PCIe config space is guest writeable, this flaw allows a local attacker to gain access and potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process."
