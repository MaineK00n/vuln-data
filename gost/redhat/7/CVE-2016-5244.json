  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The rds_inc_info_copy function in net/rds/recv.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 does not initialize a certain structure member, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory by reading an RDS message."

      "Detail": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in function rds_inc_info_copy of file net/rds/recv.c. The last field \"flags\" of object \"minfo\" is not initialized. This can leak data previously at the flags location to userspace."
