  "Statement": "* Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 4 is affected by this vulnerability. Note: although this issue affects the RadosGW S3 API, it does not affect the Swift API.\n* Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (RHOCS) 4 shipped ceph package for the usage of RHOCS 4.2 only which has reached End of Life. The shipped version of ceph package is neither used nor supported with the release of RHOCS 4.3.\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 are not affected by this flaw, as the shipped versions of `ceph` are not compiled with RadosGW support.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployments use the ceph package directly from the Ceph channel; the RHOSP package will not be updated at this time.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Sergey Bobrov (Kaspersky) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created."
