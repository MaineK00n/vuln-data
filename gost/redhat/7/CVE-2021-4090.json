    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in the NFSD in the Linux kernel. Missing sanity may lead to a write beyond bmval[bmlen-1] in nfsd4_decode_bitmap4 in fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c. In this flaw, a local attacker with user privilege may gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system integrity and confidentiality threat."
