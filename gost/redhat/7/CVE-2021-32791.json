    {
      "Detail": "mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.9, the AES GCM encryption in mod_auth_openidc uses a static IV and AAD. It is important to fix because this creates a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused. From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use dynamic values through usage of cjose AES encryption routines."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in mod_auth_openidc. The AES GCM encryption uses a static IV and AAD which could lead to other cryptographic attacks. The highest threat from this liability is to data confidentiality."
