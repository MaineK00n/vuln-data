      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way the spice-vdagentd daemon handled file transfers from the host system to the virtual machine. Any unprivileged local guest user with access to the UNIX domain socket path `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock` could use this flaw to perform a memory denial of service for spice-vdagentd or even other processes in the VM system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. This flaw affects spice-vdagent versions 0.20 and previous versions."
