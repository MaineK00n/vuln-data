  "Name": "CVE-2021-22922",
  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature, thecontents is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML file.The metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the same contentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by different servers and theclient can then download the file from one or several of them. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in curl in the way curl handles a file hash mismatch after downloading content using the Metalink feature. This flaw allows malicious actors controlling a hosting server to trick users into downloading malicious content. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity."
