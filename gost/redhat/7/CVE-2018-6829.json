However if an application uses The El-gamal algorithm implemented by libgcrypt in a particular way than the application would be vulnerable to security flaw(s).

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "cipher/elgamal.c in Libgcrypt through 1.8.2, when used to encrypt messages directly, improperly encodes plaintexts, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for Libgcrypt's ElGamal implementation."
