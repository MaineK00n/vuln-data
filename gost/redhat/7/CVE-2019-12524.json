  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling requests from users, Squid checks its rules to see if the request should be denied. Squid by default comes with rules to block access to the Cache Manager, which serves detailed server information meant for the maintainer. This rule is implemented via url_regex. The handler for url_regex rules URL decodes an incoming request. This allows an attacker to encode their URL to bypass the url_regex check, and gain access to the blocked resource."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in squid. The Cache Manager for Squid has rules that, by default, block access to anyone other than the maintainer. An attacker, with the ability to send a properly crafted URL, can bypass the url_regex check and gain access to the blocked resource. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
