  "Mitigation": "As the b2c2-flexcop-usb module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install b2c2-flexcop-usb /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-b2c2-flexcop-usb.conf\nThe system will need to be restarted if the b2c2-flexcop-usb module is already loaded. In most circumstances, the b2c2-flexcop-usb kernel module will be unable to be unloaded while the device is in use. If the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable. If you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",
