      "Detail": "Remotely observable behaviour in auth-gss2.c in OpenSSH through 7.8 could be used by remote attackers to detect existence of users on a target system when GSS2 is in use.

      "Detail": "OpenSSH server was found to respond differently to failed GSSAPI authentication attempts when the target user existed versus when that user did not exist. A remote attacker could use this bug to test for the existence of particular usernames on a target system."
