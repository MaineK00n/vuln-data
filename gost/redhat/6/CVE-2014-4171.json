  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 does not properly implement the interaction between range notification and hole punching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (i_mutex hold) by using the mmap system call to access a hole, as demonstrated by interfering with intended shmem activity by blocking completion of (1) an MADV_REMOVE madvise call or (2) an FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE fallocate call."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mmap(2), madvise(2), and fallocate(2) system calls interacted with each other while operating on virtual memory file system files. A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service."
