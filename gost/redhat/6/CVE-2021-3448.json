  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-358",
  "Statement": "",
  "Acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Petr Mensik (Red Hat).",
  "Mitigation": "The flaw can be prevented by removing `--server=\u003caddress\u003e@\u003cinterface\u003e` option or by removing the directive `server=\u003caddress\u003e@\u003cinterface\u003e`. If dnsmasq is being run through NetworkManager, please be aware that NetworkManager automatically configures dnsmasq to use the `server=\u003caddress\u003e@\u003cinterface\u003e` directive, thus in this case the only way to prevent the flaw is to remove `dns=dnsmasq` from /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file.\nIf the `server=\u003caddress\u003e@\u003cinterface\u003e` must be kept active, the impact of this flaw can be reduced by disabling the dnsmasq cache by adding `--cache-size=0` when calling dnsmasq or by adding a line with `cache-size=0` to the dnsmasq configuration file (/etc/dnsmasq.conf by default). If dnsmasq is being run through NetworkManager, create a new file in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/ and add `cache-size=0` to it.\nBy disabling the cache, you may experience a performance loss in your environment due to all DNS queries being forwarded to the upstream servers. Please evaluate if the mitigation is appropriate for the systemâ€™s environment before applying.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity."
