  "Statement": "Versions of `libvirt` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are marked as \"notaffected\" because they do not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a later version of the package. Specifically, the affected function `qemuDomainGetStatsIOThread()` was introduced in `libvirt` upstream version 4.10.0.\nRHEL Advanced Virtualization is affected by this flaw as it ships a more recent version of the package.",

    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in qemuDomainGetStatsIOThread in qemu/qemu_driver.c in libvirt 4.10.0 though 6.x before 6.1.0. A memory leak was found in the virDomainListGetStats libvirt API that is responsible for retrieving domain statistics when managing QEMU guests. This flaw allows unprivileged users with a read-only connection to cause a memory leak in the domstats command, resulting in a potential denial of service."
