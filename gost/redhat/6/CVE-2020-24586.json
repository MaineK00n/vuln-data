  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of wifi fragmentation handling. An attacker with the ability to transmit within the wireless transmission range of an access point can abuse a flaw where previous contents of wifi fragments can be unintentionally transmitted to another device."
