  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The ohci_bus_start function in the USB OHCI emulation support (hw/usb/hcd-ohci.c) in QEMU allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and QEMU process crash) via vectors related to multiple eof_timers."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built with USB OHCI emulation support. The flaw could occur when OHCI transitions to the OHCI_USB_OPERATIONAL state, leading to the creation of multiple EOF timers. A privileged user inside a guest could exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host (denial of service)."
