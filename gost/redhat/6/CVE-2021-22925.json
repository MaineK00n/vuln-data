  "Acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Red Hat Product Security.",
  "Mitigation": "This issue can be avoided by not setting any telnet options for the curl command line tool (using the -t / --telnet-option command line option) or the libcurl library (using the CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS option) when telnet protocol is not meant to be used.\nIf telnet protocol needs to be used with curl / libcurl, along with the NEW_ENV telnet option, ensure that no environment variable set via the NEW_ENV option has the name or value longer than 127 bytes.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS`in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs toTELNET servers.Due to flaw in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurlcould be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to theserver. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to theserver using a clear-text network protocol.This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly whenparsing the string provided by the application."
