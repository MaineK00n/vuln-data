  "Statement": "The information exposed by this vulnerability is typically not highly sensitive.  By default, it is only those fields returned by getpwent() and getgrent().",

  "Mitigation": "This vulnerability is only exposed if the infopipe service is enabled (enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, disabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6), and `[ifp].allowed_uids` is relied upon to protect sensitive information in the user directory.",
