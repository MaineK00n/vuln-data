  "Cwe": "CWE-266",
  "Statement": "This issue is not a big problem on its own, as it requires another remote code execution vulnerability or that a local user has the privileges to modify the squid processes to be exploited. Thus, it is actually closer to a security enhancement than a vulnerability.",

    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is run as root, it spawns its child processes as a lesser user, by default the user nobody. This is done via the leave_suid call. leave_suid leaves the Saved UID as 0. This makes it trivial for an attacker who has compromised the child process to escalate their privileges back to root."
