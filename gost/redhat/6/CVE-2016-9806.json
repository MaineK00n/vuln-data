  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Race condition in the netlink_dump function in net/netlink/af_netlink.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (double free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that makes sendmsg system calls, leading to a free operation associated with a new dump that started earlier than anticipated."

    {
      "Detail": "A double free vulnerability was found in netlink_dump, which could cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
