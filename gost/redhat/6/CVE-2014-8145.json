    {
      "Detail": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in Sound eXchange (SoX) 14.4.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted WAV file to the (1) start_read or (2) AdpcmReadBlock function."

      "Detail": "It was discovered that SoX did not correctly process NIST Sphere and WAV audio files. By tricking a victim into processing a specially crafted NIST Sphere or WAV audio file, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running SoX."
