    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** DCTStream::getChars in DCTStream.cc in Poppler 20.12.1 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted PDF document. NOTE: later reports indicate that this only affects builds from Poppler git clones in late December 2020, not the 20.12.1 release. In this situation, it should NOT be considered a Poppler vulnerability. However, several third-party Open Source projects directly rely on Poppler git clones made at arbitrary times, and therefore the CVE remains useful to users of those projects."

    {
      "Detail": "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in poppler. This flaw allows a remote attacker to provide a specially crafted PDF file that, when processed by the 'pdftops' program, leads to a crash or potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
