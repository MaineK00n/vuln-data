      "Detail": "Samba 3.6.6 through 3.6.23, 4.0.x before 4.0.18, and 4.1.x before 4.1.8, when a certain vfs shadow copy configuration is enabled, does not properly initialize the SRV_SNAPSHOT_ARRAY response field, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a (1) FSCTL_GET_SHADOW_COPY_DATA or (2) FSCTL_SRV_ENUMERATE_SNAPSHOTS request."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way Samba created responses for certain authenticated client requests when a shadow-copy VFS module was enabled. An attacker able to send an authenticated request could use this flaw to disclose limited portions of memory per each request."
