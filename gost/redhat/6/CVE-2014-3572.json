  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The ssl3_get_key_exchange function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote SSL servers to conduct ECDHE-to-ECDH downgrade attacks and trigger a loss of forward secrecy by omitting the ServerKeyExchange message."

    {
      "Detail": "It was discovered that OpenSSL would perform an ECDH key exchange with a non-ephemeral key even when the ephemeral ECDH cipher suite was selected. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method than the one requested by the user."
