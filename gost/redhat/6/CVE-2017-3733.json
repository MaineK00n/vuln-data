  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "During a renegotiation handshake if the Encrypt-Then-Mac extension is negotiated where it was not in the original handshake (or vice-versa) then this can cause OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0e to crash (dependent on ciphersuite). Both clients and servers are affected."

      "Detail": "It was found that changing the ciphersuite during a renegotiation of the Encrypt-Then-Mac extension could result in a crash of the OpenSSL server or client."
