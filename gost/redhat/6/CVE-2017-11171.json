    {
      "Detail": "Bad reference counting in the context of accept_ice_connection() in gsm-xsmp-server.c in old versions of gnome-session up until version 2.29.92 allows a local attacker to establish ICE connections to gnome-session with invalid authentication data (an invalid magic cookie). Each failed authentication attempt will leak a file descriptor in gnome-session. When the maximum number of file descriptors is exhausted in the gnome-session process, it will enter an infinite loop trying to communicate without success, consuming 100% of the CPU. The graphical session associated with the gnome-session process will stop working correctly, because communication with gnome-session is no longer possible."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A denial-of-service flaw was found in the way gnome-session handled ICE connections. A local, authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to cause the gnome-session process to exhaust its file descriptors and enter an infinite loop, thereby leading to denial of service."
