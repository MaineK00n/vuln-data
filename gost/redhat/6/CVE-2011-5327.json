      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel before 3.1, an off by one in the drivers/target/loopback/tcm_loop.c tcm_loop_make_naa_tpg() function could result in at least memory corruption."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of SCSI loopback emulation, where an off by one in the drivers/target/loopback/tcm_loop.c tcm_loop_make_naa_tpg() function could result in memory corruption. A local attacker could abuse this flaw by corrupting memory on a system where this configuration is present."
