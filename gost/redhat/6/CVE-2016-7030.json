    {
      "Detail": "FreeIPA uses a default password policy that locks an account after 5 unsuccessful authentication attempts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by locking out the account in which system services run on."

      "Detail": "It was discovered that the default IdM password policies that lock out accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts were also applied to host and service accounts. A remote unauthenticated user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service attack against kerberized services."
