  "Statement": "Not vulnerable. This issue does not affect the version of the postgresql package shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 because it does not use the vulnerable implementation of the snprintf() function provided by postgresql; the glibc implementation of this function, which is not vulnerable to this issue, is used instead.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the *printf function implementations in PostgreSQL before 9.0.19, 9.1.x before 9.1.15, 9.2.x before 9.2.10, 9.3.x before 9.3.6, and 9.4.x before 9.4.1, when running on a Windows system, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a floating point number with a large precision, as demonstrated by using the to_char function."

    {
      "Detail": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the PostgreSQL's internal printf() implementation. An authenticated database user could use a specially crafted string in an SQL query to cause PostgreSQL to crash or, potentially, lead to privilege escalation."
