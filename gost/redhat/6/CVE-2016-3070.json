  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The trace_writeback_dirty_page implementation in include/trace/events/writeback.h in the Linux kernel before 4.4 improperly interacts with mm/migrate.c, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a certain page move."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel that an attempt to move page mapped by AIO ring buffer to the other node triggers NULL pointer dereference at trace_writeback_dirty_page(), because aio_fs_backing_dev_info.dev is 0."
