  "Mitigation": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel setting prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF via the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. As such, exploiting this issue would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled. For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 (default) would mean that unprivileged users cannot use eBPF. Otherwise, to disable eBPF for unprivileged users, add:\nkernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled = 1\nTo the file \"/etc/sysctl.d/disable-ebpf.conf\"\nThen running the following command as root:\n# sudo sysctl --system",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of type confusion) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem, where protection against speculative execution attacks (Spectre mitigation) can be bypassed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
