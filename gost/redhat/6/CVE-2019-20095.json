  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "mwifiex_tm_cmd in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/cfg80211.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1.6 has some error-handling cases that did not free allocated hostcmd memory, aka CID-003b686ace82. This will cause a memory leak and denial of service."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's mwifiex driver implementation when connecting to other WiFi devices in \"Test Mode.\" A kernel memory leak can occur if an error condition is met during the parameter negotiation. This issue can lead to a denial of service if multiple error conditions meeting the repeated connection attempts are attempted."
