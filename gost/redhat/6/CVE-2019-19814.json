  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image can cause __remove_dirty_segment slab-out-of-bounds write access because an array is bounded by the number of dirty types (8) but the array index can exceed this."

    {
      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's F2FS file system exploiting the NAND flash memory-based storage device. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information."
