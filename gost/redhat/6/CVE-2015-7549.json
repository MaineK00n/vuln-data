  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The MSI-X MMIO support in hw/pci/msix.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and QEMU process crash) by leveraging failure to define the .write method."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in the QEMU emulator built with PCI MSI-X support. Because MSI-X MMIO support did not define the .write method, when the controller tried to write to the pending bit array(PBA) memory region, a segmentation fault occurred. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in denial of service."
