    {
      "Detail": "The kdcpreauth modules in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.12.x and 1.13.x before 1.13.2 do not properly track whether a client's request has been validated, which allows remote attackers to bypass an intended preauthentication requirement by providing (1) zero bytes of data or (2) an arbitrary realm name, related to plugins/preauth/otp/main.c and plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_srv.c."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the OTP kdcpreauth module of MIT Kerberos. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the requires_preauth flag on a client principal and obtain a ciphertext encrypted in the principal's long-term key. This ciphertext could be used to conduct an off-line dictionary attack against the user's password."
