    {
      "Detail": "The bubblewrap sandbox of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit, prior to 2.28.3, failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER could potentially be used to confuse xdg-desktop-portal, which allows access outside the sandbox. TIOCSTI can be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox by writing to the controlling terminal's input buffer, similar to CVE-2017-5226."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in webkitgtk in versions prior to 2.28.3 and in WPE WebKit in versions prior to 2.28.3. The bubblewrap sandbox failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER could potentially be used to confuse xdg- desktop-portal, which allows access outside the sandbox. TIOCSTI can be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox by writing to the controlling terminalâ€™s input buffer, similar to CVE-2017-5226. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
