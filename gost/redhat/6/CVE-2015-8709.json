  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel through 4.4.1 mishandles uid and gid mappings, which allows local users to gain privileges by establishing a user namespace, waiting for a root process to enter that namespace with an unsafe uid or gid, and then using the ptrace system call.  NOTE: the vendor states \"there is no kernel bug here.\""
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A privilege-escalation vulnerability was discovered in the Linux kernel built with User Namespace (CONFIG_USER_NS) support. The flaw occurred when the ptrace() system call was used on a root-owned process to enter a user namespace. A privileged namespace user could exploit this flaw to potentially escalate their privileges on the system, outside the original namespace."
