      "Detail": "An information disclosure flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos RPCSEC_GSS implementation (libgssrpc) handled certain requests. An attacker could send a specially crafted request to an application using libgssrpc to disclose a limited portion of uninitialized memory used by that application."
