  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The (1) ioport_read and (2) ioport_write functions in Xen, when qemu is used as a device model within Xen, might allow local x86 HVM guest OS administrators to gain qemu process privileges via vectors involving an out-of-range ioport access."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An out of bounds array access issue was found in the Xen virtual machine monitor, built with the QEMU ioport support. It could occur while doing ioport read/write operations, if guest was to supply a 32bit address parameter. A privileged guest user/process could use this flaw to potentially escalate their privileges on a host."
