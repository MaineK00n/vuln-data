  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "NetBIOS name services daemon (nmbd) in Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.21 and 4.1.x before 4.1.11 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that modify heap memory, involving a sizeof operation on an incorrect variable in the unstrcpy macro in string_wrappers.h."

    {
      "Detail": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Samba's NetBIOS message block daemon (nmbd). An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to send specially crafted packets that, when processed by nmbd, could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution with root privileges."
