  "Cwe": "CWE-121",
  "Statement": "The security assessment from cure53 clarifies that this issue (identified as NTP-01-0004) is not a vulnerability per se, but a weakness in ntp's internal coding style that may cause a vulnerability if particularly long variable names are defined at compile time. No such variable names are defined in upstream source code, nor in Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions of ntp.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the NTP project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Cure53 as the original reporter.",
  "Mitigation": "Implement BCP-38.\nIf you don't want to upgrade, then don't setvar variable names longer than 200-512 bytes in your ntp.conf file.\nProperly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Multiple buffer overflows in the ctl_put* functions in NTP before 4.2.8p10 and 4.3.x before 4.3.94 allow remote authenticated users to have unspecified impact via a long variable."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A vulnerability was found in NTP, in the building of response packets with custom fields. If custom fields were configured in ntp.conf with particularly long names, inclusion of these fields in the response packet could cause a buffer overflow, leading to a crash."
