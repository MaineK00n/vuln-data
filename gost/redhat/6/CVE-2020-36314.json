      "Detail": "fr-archive-libarchive.c in GNOME file-roller through 3.38.0, as used by GNOME Shell and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736."

      "Detail": "A path traversal vulnerability was found in file-roller due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736. It may still be possible to extract files outside of the intended directory in case of malicious archives containing symbolic links. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity and system availability."
