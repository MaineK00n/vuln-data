  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-327",
  "Statement": "This is a side channel attack which can used to exact pirate keys when ECDSA signatures are being generated. This attack is only feasible when the attacker is local to the machine or in certain cross-VM scenarios where the signature is being generated. Attacks over the network or via the internet are not feasible.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla Project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Billy Bob Brumley (Network and Information Security Group (NISEC), Cesar Pereida (Network and Information Security Group (NISEC), Nicola Tuveri (Network and Information Security Group (NISEC), and Yuval Yarom (Network and Information Security Group (NISEC) as the original reporters.",
  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 80 and Firefox for Android \u003c 80."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in nss. Using the EM side-channel, it is possible to extract the position of zero and non-zero wNAF digits while nss-certutil tool performs scalar multiplication during the ECDSA signature generation, leaking partial information about the ECDSA nonce. Given a small number of ECDSA signatures, this information can be used to steal the private key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
