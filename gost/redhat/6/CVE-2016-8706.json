  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-190-\u003eCWE-122",
  "Statement": "The version of memcached as shipped with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9 is affected by this issue however will not be updated. The latest version of memcached from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 can safely be allowed to supersede the earlier versions provided in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform channels.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "This flaw requires memcached to be running with SASL authentication enabled, which is not the default setting. If your memcached instances are running without the \"-S\" command-line option, they are not vulnerable.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An integer overflow in process_bin_sasl_auth function in Memcached, which is responsible for authentication commands of Memcached binary protocol, can be abused to cause heap overflow and lead to remote code execution."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in memcached's parsing of SASL authentication messages. An attacker could create a specially crafted message that would cause the memcached server to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code."
