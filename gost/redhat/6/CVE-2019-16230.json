  "Cwe": "CWE-476",
  "Statement": "This issue is rated as having Low impact because of the preconditions needed to trigger the error/resource cleanup code path (system-wide out-of-memory condition, high privileges or physical access). The attacker would have to be able to induce system-wide out-of-memory condition which itself could be seen as a local denial of service. It could be argued that having such privileges has the same impact as the flaw itself.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: A third-party software maintainer states that the work queue allocation is happening during device initialization, which for a graphics card occurs during boot. It is not attacker controllable and OOM at that time is highly unlikely."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the radeon_crtc_init function of the Linux kernel. The kernel doesn't handle work queue allocation failures correctly leading to a crash of the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
