  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-362",
  "Statement": "This issue is rated as having a Moderate impact because of the privileges required for running the known reproducer. The required privileges are CAP_BPF and CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities that are disabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the SCTP protocol itself is disabled by default and cannot be used by a user without enablement by an administrator.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Or Cohen (Palo Alto Networks) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "To mitigate this issue, prevent the module sctp from being loaded (and this is so by default for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8). Please see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for information on how to blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets (net/sctp/socket.c) before 5.12-rc8 can lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of a network service or an unprivileged process. If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)-\u003esctp.addr_wq_lock then an element is removed from the auto_asconf_splist list without any proper locking. This can be exploited by an attacker with network service privileges to escalate to root or from the context of an unprivileged user directly if a BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE is attached which denies creation of some SCTP socket."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SCTP socket functionality that triggers a race condition. This flaw allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
