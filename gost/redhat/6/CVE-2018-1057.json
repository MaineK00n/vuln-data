  "Cwe": "CWE-863",
  "Statement": "The versions of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 do not support Active Directory Domain Controller (AD-DC) mode. Therefore this flaw does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Bj√∂rn Baumbach (Sernet) as the original reporter.",
  "Mitigation": "Revoke the change passwords right for everyone from all user objects (including computers) in the directory. Note that this will prevent users from being able to change their own expired passwords, so the maximum password age should be set to a value that prevents user passwords from expiring while the workaround is in place.
