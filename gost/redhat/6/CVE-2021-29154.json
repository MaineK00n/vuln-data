  "Statement": "This flaw is rated as having Moderate impact as eBPF requires a privileged user on Red Hat Enterprise Linux to correctly load eBPF instructions that can be exploited.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "This issue does not affect most systems by default. An administrator would need to have enabled the BPF JIT to be affected.\nIt can be disabled immediately with the command:\n# echo 0 \u003e /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable\nOr it can be disabled for all subsequent boots of the system by setting a value in /etc/sysctl.d/44-bpf-jit-disable\n## start file ##\nnet.core.bpf_jit_enable=0\n## end file ##",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel through 5.11.12 have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels eBPF implementation. By default, accessing the eBPF verifier is only accessible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN.   A local user with the ability to insert eBPF instructions can abuse a flaw in eBPF to corrupt memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
