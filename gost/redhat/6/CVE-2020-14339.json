  "Cwe": "CWE-772",
  "Statement": "This flaw was introduced in `libvirt` version 6.2.0. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and 8 are not affected by this issue as they shipped an older version of the `libvirt` package which did not include the vulnerable code.\nThis issue affects versions of the `libvirt` package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Virtualization 8. Future `libvirt` package updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Virtualization 8 may address this issue.",
  "Acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Daniel Berrange (Red Hat).",
  "Mitigation": "This issue is mitigated on Red Hat Enterprise Linux if SELinux is in enforcing mode, which prevents the `/dev/mapper/control` file descriptor from being accessible by a guest user/process.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in libvirt, where it leaked a file descriptor for `/dev/mapper/control` into the QEMU process. This file descriptor allows for privileged operations to happen against the device-mapper on the host. This flaw allows a malicious guest user or process to perform operations outside of their standard permissions, potentially causing serious damage to the host operating system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
