    {
      "Detail": "** DISPUTED ** drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_interrupt.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: The security community disputes this issues as not being serious enough to be deserving a CVE id."

    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in kfd_interrupt_init in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_interrupt.c in AMD GPU driver.  Here a call to alloc_workqueue return was not validated and can cause a denial of service at the time of failure. This could allow an attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information."
