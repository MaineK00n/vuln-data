  "Statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of ntp as shipped with any Red Hat Enterprise Linux version as they already included a fix for this issue in the patch provided to fix the CVE-2015-7979 issue. The fix for this issue (developed by Red Hat) was different from the one provided by upstream, and thus ntp versions in RHEL are not affected by CVE-2016-4953.",
