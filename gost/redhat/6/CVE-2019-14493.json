  "Statement": "This flaw did not affect the versions of OpenCV as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 as they did not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a newer version of the library.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1. There is a NULL pointer dereference in the function cv::XMLParser::parse at modules/core/src/persistence.cpp."

      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenCV in the way the Cascade Classifier algorithm loaded and processed certain classifiers. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a specially crafted XML file that, when loaded by an application linked to OpenCV, would crash the application causing a denial of service."
