  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An integer overflow in the search_in_range function in regexec.c in Oniguruma 6.x before 6.9.4_rc2 leads to an out-of-bounds read, in which the offset of this read is under the control of an attacker. (This only affects the 32-bit compiled version). Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service or information disclosure, or possibly have unspecified other impact, via a crafted regular expression."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An integer overflow vulnerability leading to an out-of-bounds read was found in the way Oniguruma handled regular expression quantifiers. A remote attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a malformed regular expression that, when processed by an application linked to Oniguruma, could crash the application, causing a denial of service."
