At this time we do not believe there is a denial of service, memory leak, privilege escalation or trust barrier crossed.  The kernel may attribute errors in system logs to the wrong tunnel.  If you believe this is in error and have evidence or thoughts to the contrary please contact Red Hat Security Team.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The ip6gre_err function in net/ipv6/ip6_gre.c in the Linux kernel allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving GRE flags in an IPv6 packet, which trigger an out-of-bounds access."

      "Detail": "An issue was found in the Linux kernel ipv6 implementation of GRE tunnels which allows a remote attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds access.  At this time we understand no trust barrier has been crossed and there is no security implications in this flaw."
