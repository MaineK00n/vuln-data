  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a crash (NULL pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow for requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery). This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 up to 2.4.51 (included)."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "There's a null pointer dereference and server-side request forgery flaw in httpd's mod_proxy module, when it is configured to be used as a forward proxy. A crafted packet could be sent on the adjacent network to the forward proxy that could cause a crash, or potentially SSRF via misdirected Unix Domain Socket requests. In the worst case, this could cause a denial of service or compromise to confidentiality of data."
