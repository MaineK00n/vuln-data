  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "An attacker-controlled pointer free in Busybox's hush applet leads to denial of service and possible code execution when processing a crafted shell command, due to the shell mishandling the \u0026\u0026\u0026 string. This may be used for remote code execution under rare conditions of filtered command input."
