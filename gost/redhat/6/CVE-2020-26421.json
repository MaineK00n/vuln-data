    {
      "Detail": "A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the USB HID dissector of Wireshark while decoding packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when processed, would make Wireshark crash resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
