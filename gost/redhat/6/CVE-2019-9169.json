  "Cwe": "CWE-125",
  "Statement": "As per upstream “resource exhaustion issues which can be triggered only with crafted patterns (either during compilation or execution) are not treated as security bugs”. The regular expression compiler in glibc is only supposed to be exposed to trusted content, therefore upstream does not consider this bug as a security vulnerability.
