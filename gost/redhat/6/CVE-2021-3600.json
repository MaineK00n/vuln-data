  "Mitigation": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl.   This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.\nA kernel update will be required to mitigate the flaw for the root or users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s eBPF verification code, where the eBPF 32-bit div/mod source register truncation could lead to out-of-bounds reads and writes. By default, accessing the eBPF verifier is only possible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. This flaw allows a local user who can run eBPF instructions to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
