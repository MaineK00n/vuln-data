  "Statement": "Red Hat OpenStack Platform includes the dnsmasq-utils RPM which does not contain this flaw's affected code-paths; Red Hat OpenStack Platform is therefore listed as not affected.\nHowever, because all versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, all Red Hat OpenStack Platform users should absolutely upgrade the dnsmasq RPM from Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a matter of urgency using standard update mechanisms (such as 'yum update' or 'openstack overcloud update').",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team), Fermin J. Serna (Google Security Team), Gabriel Campana (Google Security Team), Kevin Hamacher (Google Security Team), and Ron Bowes (Google Security Team) for reporting this issue.",
