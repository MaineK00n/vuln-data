    {
      "Detail": "In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map_write() in kernel/user_namespace.c allows privilege escalation because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. A user who has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in an affected user namespace can bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace, as demonstrated by reading /etc/shadow. This occurs because an ID transformation takes place properly for the namespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaced direction."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel where map_write() in kernel/user_namespace.c allows privilege escalation as it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. An unprivileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN in an affected user namespace can bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace. This is possible because a user/group id transformation takes place properly for the namespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaced direction."
