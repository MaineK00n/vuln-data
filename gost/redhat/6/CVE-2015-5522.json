    {
      "Detail": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the ParseValue function in lexer.c in tidy before 4.9.31 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors involving a command character in an href."

      "Detail": "It was discovered that tidy did not properly process certain character sequences. By tricking an application that is using tidy into processing a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application."
