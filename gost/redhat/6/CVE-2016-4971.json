    {
      "Detail": "GNU wget before 1.18 allows remote servers to write to arbitrary files by redirecting a request from HTTP to a crafted FTP resource."

      "Detail": "It was found that wget used a file name provided by the server for the downloaded file when following a HTTP redirect to a FTP server resource. This could cause wget to create a file with a different name than expected, possibly allowing the server to execute arbitrary code on the client."
