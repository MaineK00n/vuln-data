  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "QEMU 4.2.0 has a use-after-free in hw/net/e1000e_core.c because a guest OS user can trigger an e1000e packet with the data's address set to the e1000e's MMIO address."

    {
      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the INTEL 82574 NIC (e1000e) emulator of the QEMU. The issue happens while sending packets if the guest user has set the packet data address to the e1000e's MMIO address. This flaw allows a guest user or process to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service."
