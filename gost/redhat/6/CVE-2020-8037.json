      "Detail": "A flaw was found in tcpdump while printing PPP packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send specially crafted packets that, when printed, can lead the application to allocate a large amount of memory, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
