  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Stack-based buffer overflow in hw/scsi/scsi-bus.c in QEMU, when built with SCSI-device emulation support, allows guest OS users with CAP_SYS_RAWIO permissions to cause a denial of service (instance crash) via an invalid opcode in a SCSI command descriptor block."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw has been discovered in the QEMU emulator built with SCSI-device emulation support. The emulator is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow issue, which can occur while parsing a SCSI command descriptor block with an invalid operation code. A privileged(CAP_SYS_RAWIO) user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack."
