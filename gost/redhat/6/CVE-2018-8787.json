    {
      "Detail": "FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Integer Overflow that leads to a Heap-Based Buffer Overflow in function gdi_Bitmap_Decompress() and results in a memory corruption and probably even a remote code execution."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in freerdp in versions before versions 2.0.0-rc4. An integer overflow that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in the gdi_Bitmap_Decompress() function leads to memory corruption. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
