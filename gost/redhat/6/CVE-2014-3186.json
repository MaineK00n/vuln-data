      "Detail": "Buffer overflow in the picolcd_raw_event function in devices/hid/hid-picolcd_core.c in the PicoLCD HID device driver in the Linux kernel through 3.16.3, as used in Android on Nexus 7 devices, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted device that sends a large report."

      "Detail": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Minibox PicoLCD driver handled Human Interface Device (HID) reports with an invalid size. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system."
