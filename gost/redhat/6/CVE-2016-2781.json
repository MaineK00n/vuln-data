  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal's input buffer."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that chroot was vulnerable to TIOCSTI ioctl attacks, allowing the executed program to push characters to its TTY's input buffer. While being executed as a non-privileged user, a specially crafted program could force its parent TTY to enter commands, interpreted by the shell when chroot exits."
