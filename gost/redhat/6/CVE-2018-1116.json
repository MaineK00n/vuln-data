  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in polkit before version 0.116. The implementation of the polkit_backend_interactive_authority_check_authorization function in polkitd allows to test for authentication and trigger authentication of unrelated processes owned by other users. This may result in a local DoS and information disclosure."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that Polkit's CheckAuthorization and RegisterAuthenticationAgent D-Bus calls did not validate the client provided UID. A specially crafted program could use this flaw to submit arbitrary UIDs, triggering various denial of service or minor disclosures, such as which authentication is cached in the victim's session."
