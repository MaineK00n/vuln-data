  "Statement": "This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the code with the flaw is not present in the products listed.\nThis issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as the suspected driver does not advertise that it has scatter-gather feature, which presence is essential for the flaw.\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and MRG-2, namely the [atl2] Ethernet driver which is the only driver affected. Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases might address this issue.",

    {
      "Detail": "The atl2_probe function in drivers/net/ethernet/atheros/atlx/atl2.c in the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by reading packet data."
