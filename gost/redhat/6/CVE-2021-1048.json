      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in Linux kernel's ep_loop_check_proc in fs/eventpoll.c function in the filesystem. This flaw could allow an attacker to crash the system while polling for a file that is already committed to destruction. This vulnerability could lead to a kernel information leak and a privilege escalation problem."
