  "Mitigation": "As the smsusb module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install smsusb /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-smsusb.conf \nThe system will need to be restarted if the module are already loaded. In most circumstances, the smsusb kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while the adapter is in use. If the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.\"",

    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.1.8. There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Siano Mobile Silicon MDTV receiver driver. An attacker, with physical access and a specially crafted USB device, can exploit this vulnerability, creating a NULL pointer dereference and causing the system to crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability."
