  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The dvb_frontend_free function in drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device. NOTE: the function was later renamed __dvb_frontend_free."

    {
      "Detail": "The dvb frontend management subsystem in the Linux kernel contains a use-after-free which can allow a malicious user to write to memory that may be assigned to another kernel structure. This could create memory corruption, panic, or possibly other side affects."
