  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In Artifex Ghostscript through 9.26, ephemeral or transient procedures can allow access to system operators, leading to remote code execution."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that ghostscript could leak sensitive operators on the operand stack when a pseudo-operator pushes a subroutine. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw to escape the -dSAFER protection in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the SAFER constraints."
