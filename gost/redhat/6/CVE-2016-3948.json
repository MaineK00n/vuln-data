  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Squid 3.x before 3.5.16 and 4.x before 4.0.8 improperly perform bounds checking, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted HTTP response, related to Vary headers."

      "Detail": "An incorrect boundary check was found in the way squid handled the Vary header in HTTP responses, which could lead to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP response."
