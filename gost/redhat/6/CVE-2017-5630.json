  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-73",
  "Statement": "Since pear's purpose is to download libraries for inclusion in an application, any use of `pear install` or `pear download` implicitly trusts the server. This vulnerability does not significantly extend the trust already given to pear and to servers used with it.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "This vulnerability only allows files in the current directory to be overwritten, so using `pear download` in a temporary directory effectively mitigates the risk of a dangerous file overwrite occurring.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "PECL in the download utility class in the Installer in PEAR Base System v1.10.1 does not validate file types and filenames after a redirect, which allows remote HTTP servers to overwrite files via crafted responses, as demonstrated by a .htaccess overwrite."
