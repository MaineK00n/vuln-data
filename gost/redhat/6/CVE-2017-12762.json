  "Statement": "This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "The ISDN kernel module is automatically loaded when the system boots and the ISDN service is present and enabled. The kernel modules can be prevented from being loaded by using system-wide modprobe rules. Run the following commands to blacklist the ISDN module, thus preventing them from loading:\n```# echo \"install isdn /bin/true\"\u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-isdn.conf```\nOn RHEL 6 execute the following commands as root to check if any isdn-related services are present:\n```# chkconfig --list | grep isdn```\nand disable them if they are:\n```#  chkconfig isdn off```\n(or use a name of another isdn-related service)",

      "Detail": "In /drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c: A user-controlled buffer is copied into a local buffer of constant size using strcpy without a length check which can cause a buffer overflow. This affects the Linux kernel 4.9-stable tree, 4.12-stable tree, 3.18-stable tree, and 4.4-stable tree."
