  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The kvm_apic_has_events function in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.h in the Linux kernel through 4.1.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging /dev/kvm access for an ioctl call."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A DoS flaw was found for a Linux kernel built for the x86 architecture which had the KVM virtualization support(CONFIG_KVM) enabled. The kernel would be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw in Linux kernel's kvm_apic_has_events() function while doing an ioctl. An unprivileged user able to access the \"/dev/kvm\" device could use this flaw to crash the system kernel."
