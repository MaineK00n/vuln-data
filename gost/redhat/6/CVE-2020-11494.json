    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in slc_bump in drivers/net/can/slcan.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.6.2. It allows attackers to read uninitialized can_frame data, potentially containing sensitive information from kernel stack memory, if the configuration lacks CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL, aka CID-b9258a2cece4."

    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was discovered in slc_bump in drivers/net/can/slcan.c in CAN Communication Protocol. It allows a local attacker with special user privilege (or root)  to read sensitive kernel stack information (considering CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL is not enabled) when a partially initialized data structure is exposed over the network layer."
