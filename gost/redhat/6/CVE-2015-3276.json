  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The nss_parse_ciphers function in libraries/libldap/tls_m.c in OpenLDAP does not properly parse OpenSSL-style multi-keyword mode cipher strings, which might cause a weaker than intended cipher to be used and allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP parsed OpenSSL-style cipher strings. As a result, OpenLDAP could potentially use ciphers that were not intended to be enabled."
