  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8, the RPA PCI Hotplug driver has a user-tolerable buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, allowing userspace to write data to the kernel stack frame directly. This occurs because add_slot_store and remove_slot_store mishandle drc_name '\\0' termination, aka CID-cc7a0bb058b8."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw in the Linux kernels implementation of the RPA PCI Hotplug driver for power-pc.  A user with permissions to write to the sysfs settings for this driver can trigger a buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, overwriting data in the kernel's stack."
