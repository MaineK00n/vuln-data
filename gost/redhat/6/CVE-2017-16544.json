  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox through 1.27.2, the tab autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that the tab auto-completion feature of BusyBox did not sanitize filenames, leading to execution of arbitrary escape sequences in the terminal emulator. Exploitation of this flaw by an attacker could potentially result in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks under highly specific circumstances dependent on the usage of a vulnerable terminal emulator by the user."
