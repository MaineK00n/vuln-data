  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A problem with the implementation of the new serve-stale feature in BIND 9.12 can lead to an assertion failure in rbtdb.c, even when stale-answer-enable is off. Additionally, problematic interaction between the serve-stale feature and NSEC aggressive negative caching can in some cases cause undesirable behavior from named, such as a recursion loop or excessive logging. Deliberate exploitation of this condition could cause operational problems depending on the particular manifestation -- either degradation or denial of service. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the \"serve-stale\" feature as implemented in bind. Problematic interaction between serve-stale feature and NSEC aggressive negative caching could cause denial of service."
