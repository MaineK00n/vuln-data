  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The vgacon subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.8.10 mishandles software scrollback. There is a vgacon_scrolldelta out-of-bounds read, aka CID-973c096f6a85."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of the invert video code on VGA consoles. When a local attacker attempts to scroll the console, calling an ioctl TIOCL_SCROLLCONSOLE, an out-of-bounds memory access issue occurs. This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially reading random out-of-bound memory on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability and data confidentiality."
