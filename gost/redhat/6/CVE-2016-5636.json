  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Integer overflow in the get_data function in zipimport.c in CPython (aka Python) before 2.7.12, 3.x before 3.4.5, and 3.5.x before 3.5.2 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a negative data size value, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow."

    {
      "Detail": "A vulnerability was discovered in Python, in the built-in zipimporter. A specially crafted zip file placed in a module path such that it would be loaded by a later \"import\" statement could cause a heap overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution."
