    {
      "Detail": "fpregs_state_valid in arch/x86/include/asm/fpu/internal.h in the Linux kernel before 5.4.2, when GCC 9 is used, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of incorrect fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx caching, as demonstrated by mishandling of signal-based non-cooperative preemption in Go 1.14 prereleases on amd64, aka CID-59c4bd853abc."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. When compiled with GCC 9, a vector register corruption occurs on return from a signal handler where the top page of the signal stack had not yet been paged in which can allow a local attacker with special user privilege (or root) to leak kernel internal information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
