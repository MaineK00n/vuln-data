  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The (1) BMDMA and (2) AHCI HBA interfaces in the IDE functionality in QEMU 1.0 through 2.1.3 have multiple interpretations of a function's return value, which allows guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service (memory consumption or infinite loop, and system crash) via a PRDT with zero complete sectors, related to the bmdma_prepare_buf and ahci_dma_prepare_buf functions."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way QEMU handled malformed Physical Region Descriptor Table (PRDT) data sent to the host's IDE and/or AHCI controller emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the system."
