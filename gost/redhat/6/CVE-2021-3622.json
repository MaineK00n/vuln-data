  "Cwe": "CWE-400",
  "Statement": "Any external program using the hivex library could be exposed to partial unavailability in case of a crash where a user can always retry the operation. As for libguestfs, a crash in hivex would not result in libguestfs crashing.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Galindo (Datto) for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
