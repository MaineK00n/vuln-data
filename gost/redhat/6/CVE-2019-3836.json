  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "It was discovered in gnutls before version 3.6.7 upstream that there is an uninitialized pointer access in gnutls versions 3.6.3 or later which can be triggered by certain post-handshake messages."

      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the way gnutls handled malformed TLS 1.3 asynchronous messages. An attacker could use this flaw to crash an application compiled with gnutls via invalid pointer access."
