  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "GNU Wget through 1.21.1 does not omit the Authorization header upon a redirect to a different origin, a related issue to CVE-2018-1000007."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in wget. If wget sends an Authorization header as part of a query and receives an HTTP REDIRECT to a third party in return, the Authorization header will be forwarded as part of the redirected request. This issue creates a password leak, as the second server receives the password. The highest threat from this vulnerability is confidentiality."
