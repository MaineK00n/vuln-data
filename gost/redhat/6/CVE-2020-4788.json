  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "IBM Power9 (AIX 7.1, 7.2, and VIOS 3.1) processors could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. IBM X-Force ID: 189296."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. IBM Power9 processors can speculatively operate on data stored in the L1 cache before it has been completely validated.  The attack has limited access to memory and is only able to access memory normally permissible to the execution context. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
