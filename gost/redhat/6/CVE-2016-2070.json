    {
      "Detail": "The tcp_cwnd_reduction function in net/ipv4/tcp_input.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and system crash) via crafted TCP traffic."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A divide-by-zero vulnerability was found in a way the kernel processes TCP connections. The error can occur if a connection starts another cwnd reduction phase by setting tp-\u003eprior_cwnd to the current cwnd (0) in tcp_init_cwnd_reduction(). A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash the kernel (denial of service)."
