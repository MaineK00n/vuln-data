  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "libcurl versions from 7.34.0 to before 7.64.0 are vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds read in the code handling the end-of-response for SMTP. If the buffer passed to `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains no character ending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5, then the `strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will not be returned to the caller."

      "Detail": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way curl handled certain SMTP responses. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash curl."
