  "Statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 because it uses the NSS backend, not OpenSSL.  It does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 which uses the OpenSSL backend.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
