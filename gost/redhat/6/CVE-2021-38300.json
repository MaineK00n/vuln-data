  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context. This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The cBPF JIT compiler may produce machine code with incorrect branches. This flaw allows an unprivileged user to craft anomalous machine code, where the control flow is hijacked to execute arbitrary kernel code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
