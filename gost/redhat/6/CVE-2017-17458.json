  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially malformed repository can cause Git subrepositories to run arbitrary code in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script checked into the repository. Typical use of Mercurial prevents construction of such repositories, but they can be created programmatically."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that mercurial was vulnerable to cross repositories modification. A specially crafted mercurial repository could trigger arbitrary commands on a client during commands such as clone or update."
