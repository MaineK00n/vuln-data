  "Statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are not affected by this issue as they shipped an older version of `libvirt` which did not include the vulnerable code. This flaw affects versions of the `libvirt` package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Virtualization 8. Future `libvirt` package updates for these products may address this issue.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API, in versions before 6.8.0, responsible for requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain. This flaw affects the polkit access control driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
