  "Statement": "This issue is only practical to exploit on 32-bit systems, and then only when the memory limit is raised from its default to a value larger than 2 GiB.  The default settings make exploitation impossible. For these reasons, PHP upstream developers do not consider this to be a security issue.  Red Hat Software Collections and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later only distribute PHP built for 64-bit systems.",

  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The zend_string_extend function in Zend/zend_string.h in PHP through 7.1.5 does not prevent changes to string objects that result in a negative length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging a script's use of .= with a long string."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "An integer overflow vulnerability in PHP can lead to a buffer overflow when constructing extremely long strings with the \".=\" operator.  In unusual circumstances, this could be used by an attacker to cause an application to crash or possibly have other consequences."
