  "DocumentDistribution": "",
  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The SMB2_tcon function in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c in the Linux kernel before 3.16.3 allows remote CIFS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and client system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by deleting the IPC$ share during resolution of DFS referrals."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Common Internet File System (CIFS) implementation handled mounting of file system shares. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a client system that would mount a file system share from a malicious server."
