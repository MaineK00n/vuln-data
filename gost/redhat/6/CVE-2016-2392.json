  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The is_rndis function in the USB Net device emulator (hw/usb/dev-network.c) in QEMU before 2.5.1 does not properly validate USB configuration descriptor objects, which allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and QEMU process crash) via vectors involving a remote NDIS control message packet."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built with USB Net device emulation support. The flaw could occur while processing remote NDIS control message packets, if the USB configuration descriptor object is NULL. A privileged user inside a guest could exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance (denial of service)."
