  "Statement": "Versions of `libvirt` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are marked as \"notaffected\" as they do not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a later version of the package. Specifically, the affected internal function `storagePoolLookupByTargetPathCallback` was introduced in `libvirt` upstream version v3.10.0, whereas the `virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath` method was exported as a public API in version 4.1.0.",

    {
      "Detail": "A NULL pointer dereference was found in the libvirt API responsible introduced in upstream version 3.10.0, and fixed in libvirt 6.0.0, for fetching a storage pool based on its target path. In more detail, this flaw affects storage pools created without a target path such as network-based pools like gluster and RBD. Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could abuse this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a potential denial of service."
