  "Cwe": "CWE-732",
  "Statement": "The issue is rated as having Low impact because the issue is not present when hardware-assisted paging (also known as nested paging and Second Level Address Translation)  is enabled. Hardware-assisted paging is enabled by default for CPUs that support it. Any realistic real-life virtualization scenario benefits greatly from hardware assisted paging speed up, so deployments without hardware-assisted paging are very rare.",
  "Acknowledgement": "",
  "Mitigation": "Do not disable hardware-assisted paging (also known as nested paging and Second Level Address Translation) on your hosts. The default is on.",
