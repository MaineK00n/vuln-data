  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the path_openat function in fs/namei.c in the Linux kernel 3.x and 4.x before 4.0.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via O_TMPFILE filesystem operations that leverage a duplicate cleanup operation."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernels function path_openat() in which incorrectly clears up twice (as part of path_lookupat() called by do_tmpfile()). Clearing twice can lead to a double fput(). A local, unauthenticated user could exploit this flaw to possibly cause a denial of service."
