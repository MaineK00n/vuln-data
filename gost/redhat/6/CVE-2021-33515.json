  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "The submission service in Dovecot before 2.3.15 allows STARTTLS command injection in lib-smtp. Sensitive information can be redirected to an attacker-controlled address."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "It was found that dovecot could still accept plaintext commands while the STARTTLS negotiation process is ongoing. This could allow an active person in the middle, with valid credentials on dovecot, to, for example, steal confidential data such as the client's emails and passwords."
