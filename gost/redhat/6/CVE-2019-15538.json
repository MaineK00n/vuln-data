    {
      "Detail": "An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9. XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of being out of disk quota. xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing to unlock the ILOCK after the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call fails. This is primarily a local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS."
    },
    {
      "Detail": "A flaw was found in the XFS file system in the Linux kernel. An acquired ILOCK was not freed/unlock when the call to xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve fails and the lock is still held and can lead to denial to access for that device. This is primarily a local denial of service but could result in a remote denial of service if the XFS file system is exported as an NFS file system."
