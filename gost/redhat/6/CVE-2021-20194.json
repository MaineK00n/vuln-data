  "Iava": "",
  "Cwe": "CWE-400",
  "Statement": "This flaw is rated as having Moderate impact because of the need to have elevated privileges or non-standard configuration for running BPF script.",
  "Acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Loris Reiff for reporting this issue.",
  "Mitigation": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF.",

  "Details": [
    {
      "Detail": "There is a vulnerability in the linux kernel versions higher than 5.2 (if kernel compiled with config params CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y , CONFIG_BPF=y , CONFIG_CGROUPS=y , CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=y , CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY not set, and BPF hook to getsockopt is registered). As result of BPF execution, the local user can trigger bug in __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_getsockopt() function that can lead to heap overflow (because of non-hardened usercopy). The impact of attack could be deny of service or possibly privileges escalation."
