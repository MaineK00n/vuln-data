  "description": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway). The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. Ceph versions 3.x and 4.x are vulnerable to this issue.",
