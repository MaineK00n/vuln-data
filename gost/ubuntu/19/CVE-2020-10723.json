  "description": "A memory corruption issue was found in DPDK versions 17.05 and above. This flaw is caused by an integer truncation on the index of a payload. Under certain circumstances, the index (a UInt) is copied and truncated into a uint16, which can lead to out of bound indexing and possible memory corruption.",
