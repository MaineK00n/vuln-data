  "description": "An issue was discovered in openfortivpn 1.11.0 when used with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later. tunnel.c mishandles certificate validation because the hostname check operates on uninitialized memory. The outcome is that a valid certificate is never accepted (only a malformed certificate may be accepted).",
