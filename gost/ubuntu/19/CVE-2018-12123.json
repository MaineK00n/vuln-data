  "description": "Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0: Hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol: If a Node.js application is using url.parse() to determine the URL hostname, that hostname can be spoofed by using a mixed case \"javascript:\" (e.g. \"javAscript:\") protocol (other protocols are not affected). If security decisions are made about the URL based on the hostname, they may be incorrect.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Martin Bajanik discovered that the url.parse() method would return incorrect results if it received specially crafted input. An attacker could use this vulnerability to spoof the hostname and bypass hostname-specific security controls.",
