  "description": "** DISPUTED ** pandas through 1.0.3 can unserialize and execute commands from an untrusted file that is passed to the read_pickle() function, if __reduce__ makes an os.system call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because the read_pickle() function is documented as unsafe and it is the user's responsibility to use the function in a secure manner.",
