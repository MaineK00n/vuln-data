  "description": "Ruby OpenID (aka ruby-openid) through 2.8.0 has a remotely exploitable flaw. This library is used by Rails web applications to integrate with OpenID Providers. Severity can range from medium to critical, depending on how a web application developer chose to employ the ruby-openid library.
