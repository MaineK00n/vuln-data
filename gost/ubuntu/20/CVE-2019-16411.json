  "description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.4. By sending multiple IPv4 packets that have invalid IPv4Options, the function IPV4OptValidateTimestamp in decode-ipv4.c tries to access a memory region that is not allocated. There is a check for o-\u003elen \u003c 5 (corresponding to 2 bytes of header and 3 bytes of data). Then, \"flag = *(o-\u003edata + 3)\" places one beyond the 3 bytes, because the code should have been \"flag = *(o-\u003edata + 1)\" instead.",
