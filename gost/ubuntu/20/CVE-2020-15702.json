  "description": "TOCTOU Race Condition vulnerability in apport allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may exit the crashed process and exploit PID recycling to spawn a root process with the same PID as the crashed process, which can then be used to escalate privileges. Fixed in 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.24, 2.20.9 versions prior to 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.16 and 2.20.11 versions prior to 2.20.11-0ubuntu27.6. Was ZDI-CAN-11234.",
