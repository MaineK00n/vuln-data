  "description": "It was found that the Token Processing Service (TPS) did not properly sanitize the Token IDs from the \"Activity\" page, enabling a Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker could trick an authenticated victim into creating a specially crafted activity, which would execute arbitrary JavaScript code when viewed in a browser. All versions of pki-core are believed to be vulnerable.",
