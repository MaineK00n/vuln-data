  "description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 68.8, Firefox \u003c 76, and Thunderbird \u003c 68.8.0.",
