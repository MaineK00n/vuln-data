  "description": "An issue was discovered in app-layer-ssl.c in Suricata 4.1.4. Upon receiving a corrupted SSLv3 (TLS 1.2) packet, the parser function TLSDecodeHSHelloExtensions tries to access a memory region that is not allocated, because the expected length of HSHelloExtensions does not match the real length of the HSHelloExtensions part of the packet.",
