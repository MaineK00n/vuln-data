  "description": "An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the bootp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'bootp_t' structure. A malicious guest could use this flaw to leak 10 bytes of uninitialized heap memory from the host. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects libslirp versions prior to 4.6.0.",
