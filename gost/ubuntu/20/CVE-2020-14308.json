  "description": "In grub2 versions before 2.06 the grub memory allocator doesn't check for possible arithmetic overflows on the requested allocation size. This leads the function to return invalid memory allocations which can be further used to cause possible integrity, confidentiality and availability impacts during the boot process.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the memory allocator for GRUB2 did not validate allocation size, resulting in multiple integer overflows and heap-based buffer overflows when handling certain filesystems, PNG images or disk metadata. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
