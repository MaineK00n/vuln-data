  "description": "An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.",

  "notes": [
    {
      "note": "seth-arnold\u003e This has a very high risk of regression. Email addresses should not be validated beyond making sure there's at least one byte on both sides of an '@' sign. Legal email addresses are significantly more complicated than what is easy to express in regex."

      "note": "seth-arnold\u003e Whatever validation this module provides is in my opinion suspect."
