  "description": "Improper isolation of shared resources in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Joseph Nuzman discovered that some Intel processors may not properly apply EIBRS mitigations (originally developed for CVE-2017-5715) and hence may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.",
