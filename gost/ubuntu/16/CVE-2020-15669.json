  "description": "When aborting an operation, such as a fetch, an abort signal may be deleted while alerting the objects to be notified. This results in a use-after-free and we presume that with enough effort it could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 68.12 and Thunderbird \u003c 68.12.",
