  "description": "Because of an integer overflow in sam2p 0.49.3, a loop executes 0xffffffff times, ending with an invalid read of size 1 in the Image::Indexed::sortPal function in image.cpp. However, this also causes memory corruption because of an attempted write to the invalid d[0xfffffffe] array element.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that Sam2p incorrectly handled certain image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
