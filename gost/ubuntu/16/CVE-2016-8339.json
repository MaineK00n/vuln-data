  "description": "A buffer overflow in Redis 3.2.x prior to 3.2.4 causes arbitrary code execution when a crafted command is sent. An out of bounds write vulnerability exists in the handling of the client-output-buffer-limit option during the CONFIG SET command for the Redis data structure store. A crafted CONFIG SET command can lead to an out of bounds write potentially resulting in code execution.",
