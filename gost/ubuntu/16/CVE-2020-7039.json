  "description": "tcp_emu in tcp_subr.c in libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, mismanages memory, as demonstrated by IRC DCC commands in EMU_IRC. This can cause a heap-based buffer overflow or other out-of-bounds access which can lead to a DoS or potential execute arbitrary code.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a heap-based buffer overflow or other out-of-bounds access, which can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potential execute arbitrary code.",
