  "description": "The parseRTSPRequestString function in Live Networks Live555 Streaming Media 2013.11.26, as used in VideoLAN VLC Media Player, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a space character at the beginning of an RTSP message, which triggers an integer underflow, infinite loop, and buffer overflow.
