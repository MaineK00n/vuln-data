  "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u121, 7u111, 8u102; and Java SE Embedded 8u101 allows remote attackers to affect integrity via vectors related to Libraries.",

      "note": "sbeattie\u003e The following algorithms and key sizes are restricted in this release: - MD2 (in either the digest or signature algorithm) - RSA keys less than 1024 bits Upstream is planning to restrict MD5-based signatures in signed JARs in the January 2017 CPU. . The list of disabled algorithms is controlled via a new security property, jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms, in the java.security file. This property contains a list of disabled algorithms and key sizes for cryptographically signed JAR files."
