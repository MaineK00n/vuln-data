  "description": "Improper input validation together with an integer overflow in the EAP-TLS protocol implementation in PPPD may cause a crash, information disclosure, or authentication bypass. This implementation is distributed as a patch for PPPD 0.91, and includes the affected eap.c and eap-tls.c files. Configurations that use the `refuse-app` option are unaffected.",
