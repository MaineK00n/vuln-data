  "description": "hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 allow an incorrect indication of disconnection in certain situations because source address validation is mishandled. This is a denial of service that should have been prevented by PMF (aka management frame protection). The attacker must send a crafted 802.11 frame from a location that is within the 802.11 communications range.",
