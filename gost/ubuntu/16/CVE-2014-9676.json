  "description": "The seg_write_packet function in libavformat/segment.c in ffmpeg 2.1.4 and earlier does not free the correct memory location, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (\"invalid memory handler\") and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted video that triggers a use after free.",
