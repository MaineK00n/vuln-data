  "description": "An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name may be able to circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into: providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient or accepting bogus NOTIFY packets. Affects BIND 9.4.0-\u003e9.8.8, 9.9.0-\u003e9.9.10-P1, 9.10.0-\u003e9.10.5-P1, 9.11.0-\u003e9.11.1-P1, 9.9.3-S1-\u003e9.9.10-S2, 9.10.5-S1-\u003e9.10.5-S2.",
