  "description": "A mishandled zero case was discovered in opj_j2k_set_cinema_parameters in lib/openjp2/j2k.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0. The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds write, which may lead to remote denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow affecting opj_write_bytes_LE in lib/openjp2/cio.c and opj_j2k_write_sot in lib/openjp2/j2k.c) or possibly remote code execution.",
