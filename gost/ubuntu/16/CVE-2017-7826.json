  "description": "Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 56 and Firefox ESR 52.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 57, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.5, and Thunderbird \u003c 52.5.",
