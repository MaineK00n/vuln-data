  "description": "tif_getimage.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10, as used in GDAL through 3.0.1 and other products, has an integer overflow that potentially causes a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted RGBA image, related to a \"Negative-size-param\" condition.",

If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
