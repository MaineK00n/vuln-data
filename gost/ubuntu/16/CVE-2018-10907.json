  "description": "It was found that glusterfs server is vulnerable to multiple stack based buffer overflows due to functions in server-rpc-fopc.c allocating fixed size buffers using 'alloca(3)'. An authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a gluster volume and sending a string longer that the fixed buffer size to cause crash or potential code execution.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled mounting volumes. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or run arbitrary code.",
