  "description": "Insufficient validation of untrusted input in Blink's mailto: handling in Google Chrome prior to 59.0.3071.86 for Linux, Windows, and Mac allowed a remote attacker to perform command injection via a crafted HTML page, a similar issue to CVE-2004-0121. For example, characters such as * have an incorrect interaction with xdg-email in xdg-utils, and a space character can be used in front of a command-line argument.",
