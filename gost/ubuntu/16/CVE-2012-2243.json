  "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mahara 1.4.x before 1.4.5 and 1.5.x before 1.5.4 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by uploading an XML file with the xhtml extension, which is rendered inline as script.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with CVE-2012-2244 to execute arbitrary code without authentication, as demonstrated by modifying the clamav path.",
