  "description": "GRUB2 contains a race condition in grub_script_function_create() leading to a use-after-free vulnerability which can be triggered by redefining a function whilst the same function is already executing, leading to arbitrary code execution and secure boot restriction bypass. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Chris Coulson discovered that the GRUB2 function handling code did not properly handle a function being redefined, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
