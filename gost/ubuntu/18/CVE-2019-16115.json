  "description": "In Xpdf 4.01.01, a stack-based buffer under-read could be triggered in IdentityFunction::transform in Function.cc, used by GfxAxialShading::getColor. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftoppm tool. It allows an attacker to use a crafted PDF file to cause Denial of Service or possibly unspecified other impact.",
