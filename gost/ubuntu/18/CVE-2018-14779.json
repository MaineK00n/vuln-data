  "description": "A buffer overflow issue was discovered in the Yubico-Piv 1.5.0 smartcard driver. The file lib/ykpiv.c contains the following code in the function `ykpiv_transfer_data()`: {% highlight c %} if(*out_len + recv_len - 2 \u003e max_out) { fprintf(stderr, \"Output buffer to small, wanted to write %lu, max was %lu.\", *out_len + recv_len - 2, max_out); } if(out_data) { memcpy(out_data, data, recv_len - 2); out_data += recv_len - 2; *out_len += recv_len - 2; } {% endhighlight %} -- it is clearly checked whether the buffer is big enough to hold the data copied using `memcpy()`, but no error handling happens to avoid the `memcpy()` in such cases. This code path can be triggered with malicious data coming from a smartcard.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that libykpiv, a supporting library of the Yubico PIV tool and YubiKey PIV Manager, mishandled specially crafted input. An attacker with a custom-made, malicious USB device could potentially execute arbitrary code on a computer running the Yubico PIV Tool or Yubikey PIV Manager.",
