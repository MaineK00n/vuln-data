  "description": "When starting Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2, configured with the SaslZkACLProvider or VMParamsAllAndReadonlyDigestZkACLProvider and no existing security.json znode, if the optional read-only user is configured then Solr would not treat that node as a sensitive path and would allow it to be readable. Additionally, with any ZkACLProvider, if the security.json is already present, Solr will not automatically update the ACLs.",
