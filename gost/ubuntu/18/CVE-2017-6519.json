  "description": "avahi-daemon in Avahi through 0.6.32 and 0.7 inadvertently responds to IPv6 unicast queries with source addresses that are not on-link, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) and may cause information leakage by obtaining potentially sensitive information from the responding device via port-5353 UDP packets.  NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2015-2809.",
