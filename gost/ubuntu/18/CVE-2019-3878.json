  "description": "A vulnerability was found in mod_auth_mellon before v0.14.2. If Apache is configured as a reverse proxy and mod_auth_mellon is configured to only let through authenticated users (with the require valid-user directive), adding special HTTP headers that are normally used to start the special SAML ECP (non-browser based) can be used to bypass authentication.",
