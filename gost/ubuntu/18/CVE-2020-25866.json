  "description": "In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.6 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.13, the BLIP protocol dissector has a NULL pointer dereference because a buffer was sized for compressed (not uncompressed) messages. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-blip.c by allowing reasonable compression ratios and rejecting ZIP bombs.",
