  "description": "In Trusted Firmware Mbed TLS 2.24.0, a side-channel vulnerability in base64 PEM file decoding allows system-level (administrator) attackers to obtain information about secret RSA keys via a controlled-channel and side-channel attack on software running in isolated environments that can be single stepped, especially Intel SGX.",

      "note": "sarnold\u003e It looks like an entire new class of side-channel-free functions was introduced in newer versions of mbedtls; backporting all of them probably doesn't make sense, this fix only makes sense in context of trying to provide constant-time execution that limits side-channel bandwidth to adversaries on the same machine."
