  "description": "chrony before 1.31.1 does not initialize the last \"next\" pointer when saving unacknowledged replies to command requests, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a large number of command requests.",
