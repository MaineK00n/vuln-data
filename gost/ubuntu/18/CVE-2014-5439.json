  "description": "Multiple Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities exists in Sniffit prior to 0.3.7 via a crafted configuration file that will bypass Non-eXecutable bit NX, stack smashing protector SSP, and address space layout randomization ASLR protection mechanisms, which could let a malicious user execute arbitrary code.",
