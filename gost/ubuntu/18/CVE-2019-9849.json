This mode is not the default mode, but can be enabled by users who want to disable LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources within a document. A flaw existed where bullet graphics were omitted from this protection prior to version 6.2.5. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.5.",
