  "description": "A cryptographic cache-based side channel in the RSA implementation in Botan before 1.10.17, and 1.11.x and 2.x before 2.3.0, allows a local attacker to recover information about RSA secret keys, as demonstrated by CacheD. This occurs because an array is indexed with bits derived from a secret key.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that Botan did not properly implement RSA. An attacker could possibly use this to perform a side-channel attack and recover information about RSA secret keys.",
