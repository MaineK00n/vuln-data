  "description": "bluetoothd from bluez incorrectly saves adapters' Discoverable status when a device is powered down, and restores it when powered up.  If a device is powered down while discoverable, it will be discoverable when powered on again.  This could lead to inadvertent exposure of the bluetooth stack to physically nearby attackers.",
