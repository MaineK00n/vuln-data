  "description": "An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. In apport/ui.py, Apport reads the CrashDB field and it then evaluates the field as Python code if it begins with a \"{\". This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Python code.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that the crash file parser in Apport improperly treated the CrashDB field as python code. An attacker could use this to convince a user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user.",
