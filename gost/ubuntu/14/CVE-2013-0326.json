Even if this were not the case, the files would be readable by the the libvirt-qemu:kvm user, so changing the permissions to 0640 would not help greatly. Therefore the protection would only be against other users on the system and a typical production Nova installation will not have these types of users or extra services. Furthermore, changing the permissions in a security update could be disruptive to production systems on upgrade."
