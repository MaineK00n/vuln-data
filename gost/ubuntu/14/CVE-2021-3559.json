  "description": "A flaw was found in libvirt in the virConnectListAllNodeDevices API in versions before 7.0.0. It only affects hosts with a PCI device and driver that supports mediated devices (e.g., GRID driver). This flaw could be used by an unprivileged client with a read-only connection to crash the libvirt daemon by executing the 'nodedev-list' virsh command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
