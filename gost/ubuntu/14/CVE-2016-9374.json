  "description": "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.7, the AllJoyn dissector could crash with a buffer over-read, triggered by network traffic or a capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-alljoyn.c by ensuring that a length variable properly tracked the state of a signature variable.",
