  "description": "When in an endless loop, a website specifying a custom cursor using CSS could make it look like the user is interacting with the user interface, when they are not. This could lead to a perceived broken state, especially when interactions with existing browser dialogs and warnings do not work. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.1, Firefox \u003c 79, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.1.",
