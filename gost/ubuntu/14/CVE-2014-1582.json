  "description": "The Public Key Pinning (PKP) implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0 does not properly consider the connection-coalescing behavior of SPDY and HTTP/2 in the case of a shared IP address, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass an intended pinning configuration and spoof a web site by providing a valid certificate from an arbitrary recognized Certification Authority.",
