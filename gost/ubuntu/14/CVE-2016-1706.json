  "description": "The PPAPI implementation in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82 does not validate the origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process that should have come from the browser process, which allows remote attackers to bypass a sandbox protection mechanism via an unexpected message type, related to broker_process_dispatcher.cc, ppapi_plugin_process_host.cc, ppapi_thread.cc, and render_frame_message_filter.cc.",
