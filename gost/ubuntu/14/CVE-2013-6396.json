  "description": "The OpenStack Python client library for Swift (python-swiftclient) 1.0 through 1.9.0 does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.",

Patch adds an --insecure option that would have to be enabled by default in the security update so as not to break production systems. Depending on upstream's decision, Ubuntu may only fix 14.04."
