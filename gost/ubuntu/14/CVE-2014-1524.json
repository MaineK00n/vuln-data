  "description": "The nsXBLProtoImpl::InstallImplementation function in Mozilla Firefox before 29.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.5, Thunderbird before 24.5, and SeaMonkey before 2.26 does not properly check whether objects are XBL objects, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) via crafted JavaScript code that accesses a non-XBL object as if it were an XBL object.",
