  "description": "In the previous mitigations for Spectre, the resolution or precision of various methods was reduced to counteract the ability to measure precise time intervals. In that work PerformanceNavigationTiming was not adjusted but it was found that it could be used as a precision timer. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.1, and Firefox \u003c 61.",
