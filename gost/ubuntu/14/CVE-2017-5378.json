  "description": "Hashed codes of JavaScript objects are shared between pages. This allows for pointer leaks because an object's address can be discovered through hash codes, and also allows for data leakage of an object's content using these hash codes. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 45.7, Firefox ESR \u003c 45.7, and Firefox \u003c 51.",
