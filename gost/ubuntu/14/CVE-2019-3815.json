  "description": "A memory leak was discovered in the backport of fixes for CVE-2018-16864 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Function dispatch_message_real() in journald-server.c does not free the memory allocated by set_iovec_field_free() to store the `_CMDLINE=` entry. A local attacker may use this flaw to make systemd-journald crash. This issue only affects versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise since v219-62.2.",
