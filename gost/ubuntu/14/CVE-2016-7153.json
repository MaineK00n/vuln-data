      "note": "seth-arnold\u003e NVD had this CVE assigned to multiple browers as of 2016-09-12. This CVE appears to cover a wide variety of browser side channels demonstrating the time difference between first byte and last byte in a response. This can be used both for compression-based determinations of exact strings from requests that are reflected in responses as well as uncompressed responses from sites that have disabled compression to mitigate BEAST or CRIME."
