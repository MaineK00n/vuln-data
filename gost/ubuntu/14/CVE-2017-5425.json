  "description": "The Gecko Media Plugin sandbox allows access to local files that match specific regular expressions. On OS OX, this matching allows access to some data in subdirectories of \"/private/var\" that could expose personal or temporary data. This has been updated to not allow access to \"/private/var\" and its subdirectories. Note: this issue only affects OS X. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 52 and Thunderbird \u003c 52.",
