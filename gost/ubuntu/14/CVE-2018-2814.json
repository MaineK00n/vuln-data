  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Hotspot). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u181, 7u171, 8u162 and 10; Java SE Embedded: 8u161. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the Hotspot component of OpenJDK affecting confidentiality, data integrity, and availability.  An attacker could use this to specially craft an Java application that caused a denial of service or bypassed sandbox restrictions.",
