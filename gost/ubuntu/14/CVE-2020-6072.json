  "description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the label-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed labels in mDNS messages, the rr_decode function's return value is not checked, leading to a double free that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.",
