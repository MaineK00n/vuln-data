  "description": "** DISPUTED **   An issue was discovered in NumPy 1.16.0 and earlier. It uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a numpy.load call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is  a behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example)  loading serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated  sources.",
